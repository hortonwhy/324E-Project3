several
years
ago
circumstances
thrust
me
into
a
position
in
which
it
became
possible
for
the
friend
who
figures
in
these
pages
as
godfrey
loring
to
do
me
a
favor
he
being
both
wise
and
kindly
never
misses
a
good
chance
to
put
another
under
obligations
he
did
me
the
favor
i
gratefully
if
reluctantly
acquiesced
now
after
many
days
he
collects
when
you
shall
have
read
what
follows
you
may
utterly
reject
my
extenuating
plea
that
any
and
every
point
of
view
upon
life
is
worthy
of
attention
even
though
it
serve
only
to
confirm
us
in
our
previous
ideas
and
beliefs
you
may
say
that
i
should
have
repudiated
my
debt
should
have
refused
to
edit
and
publish
the
manuscript
he
confided
to
me
you
may
say
that
the
general
racial
obligation
to
mankind
and
to
womankind
takes
precedence
over
a
private
and
personal
obligation
unfortunately
i
happen
to
be
not
of
the
philanthropic
temperament
my
sense
of
the
personal
is
strong
my
sense
of
the
general
weak
that
is
to
say
weak
in
comparison
if
loring
had
been
within
reach
i
think
i
should
have
gone
to
him
and
pleaded
for
release
but
as
luck
will
have
it
he
is
off
yachting
to
peep
about
in
the
remote
inlets
and
islets
of
australasia
and
the
south
seas
for
several
years
to
aggravate
my
situation
in
the
letter
accompanying
the
manuscript
after
several
pages
of
the
discriminating
praise
most
dear
to
a
writer
s
heart
he
did
me
the
supreme
honor
of
saying
that
in
his
work
he
had
striven
to
copy
as
closely
as
might
be
your
style
and
your
methods
to
help
me
to
the
hearing
i
want
and
to
lighten
your
labors
as
editor
i
assure
him
and
the
public
that
in
any
event
i
should
have
done
little
editing
of
his
curious
production
beyond
such
as
a
proofreader
might
have
found
necessary
as
it
is
i
have
done
practically
no
editing
at
all
in
form
and
in
substance
from
title
to
finis
the
work
is
his
i
am
merely
its
sponsor
and
in
circumstances
that
would
forbid
me
were
i
disposed
to
qualify
my
sponsorship
with
even
so
mild
a
disclaimer
as
reluctance
have
i
said
more
than
a
loyal
friend
should
if
so
on
the
other
hand
have
i
not
done
all
that
a
loyal
friend
could
i
i
am
tempted
to
begin
with
our
arrival
in
fifth
avenue
new
york
city
in
the
pomp
and
circumstance
befitting
that
region
of
regal
splendor
i
should
at
once
catch
the
attention
of
the
women
and
my
literary
friends
tell
me
that
to
make
any
headway
with
a
story
in
america
it
is
necessary
to
catch
the
women
because
the
men
either
do
not
read
books
at
all
or
read
only
what
they
hear
the
women
talking
about
and
i
know
well
none
knows
better
that
our
women
of
the
book
buying
class
and
probably
of
all
classes
love
to
amuse
their
useless
idleness
with
books
that
help
them
to
dream
of
wasting
large
sums
of
money
upon
luxuries
and
extravagances
upon
entertaining
grand
people
in
grand
houses
and
being
entertained
by
them
they
tell
me
and
i
believe
it
that
our
women
abhor
stories
of
middle
class
life
abhor
truth
telling
stories
of
any
kind
like
only
what
assures
them
that
the
promptings
of
their
own
vanities
and
sentimental
shams
are
true
but
patience
gentle
reader
you
with
the
foolish
chimera
haunted
brain
with
the
silly
ideas
of
life
with
the
ignorance
of
human
nature
including
your

the
love
of
sloppy
and
tawdry
clap

gentle

i
shall
begin
humbly
in
the
social
scale
i
shall

shall
pass
on
to
the

grandeur

your
snobbish

you
will
soon
smell

fine
perfumes
only
the
aromas
of
food
cooked
by
expensive
chefs

will
sit
in

in
bedrooms

magnificent
as
the
architects
and
decorators
and
other
purveyors

very
rich

been
able

with
your
box
of
caramels
and
your
hair
in
curl
papers
and
your
household
work
undone
patience
a
feast
awaits
you
there
has
been
much
in
the
papers
these
last
few
years
about
the
splendid
families
we
my
wife
and
i
came
of
some
time
ago
one
of
the
english
dukes
a
nice
chap
with
nothing
to
do
and
a
quaint
sense
of
humor
assembled
on
his
estate
for
a
sort
of
holiday
and
picnic
all
the
members
of
his
ancient
and
proud
family
who
could
be
got
together
by
several
months
of
diligent
search
it
was
a
strange
and
awful
throng
that
covered
the
lawns
before
the
ducal
castle
on
the
appointed
day
there
was
a
handful
of
fairly
presentable
more
or
less
prosperous
persons
but
the
most
of
the
duke
s
cousins
near
and
remote
were
tramps
bartenders
jail
birds
women
of
the
town
field
hands
male
and
female
sewer
cleaners
chimney
sweeps
needlewomen
curates
small
shopkeepers
and
others
of
the
species
that
are
as
a
stench
unto
delicate
aristocratic
nostrils
the
duke
was
delighted
with
his
picnic
pronounced
it
a
huge
success
but
then
his
grace
had
a
sense
of
humor
and
was
not
an
american
aristocrat
all
this
by
way
of
preparation
for
the
admission
that
the
branch
of
the
loring
family
from
which
i
come
and
the
branch
of
the
wheatlands
family
to
which
the
girl
i
married
belongs
were
far
from
magnificent
were
no
more
imposing
then
well
than
the
families
of
any
of
our
american
aristocrats
like
theirs
our
genealogical
tree
most
imposingly
printed
and
bound
and
proudly
exhibited
on
a
special
stand
in
the
library
of
our
new
york
palace
that
genealogical
tree
for
all
its
air
of
honesty
for
all
its
documentary
proofs
worm
eaten
and
age
stained
was
like
an
artificial
palm
bedded
in
artificial
moss
the
truth
is
aristocracy
does
not
thrive
in
america
but
only
the
pretense
of
it
and
that
must
be
kept
alive
by
constant
renewals
both
here
and
abroad
i
am
constantly
running
across
traces
of
illegitimacy
substitution
and
other
forms
of
genealogical
flim
flam
but
let
that
pass
whoever
is
or
is
not
aristocratic
certainly
godfrey
loring
and
edna
wheatlands
are
not
or
rather
were
not
my
father
kept
a
dejected
little
grocery
in
passaic
n
j
he
did
not
become
a
retired
merchant
and
capitalist
until
i
was
able
to
retire
and
capitalize
him
edna
s
father
was
no
you
guess
wrong
not
a
butcher
but
an
undertaker
whew
i
am
glad
to
have
these
shameful
secrets
off
the
chest
as
they
say
in
the
bowery
he
this
wheatlands
undertaker
to
the
poor
and
near
poor
of
the
then
village
of
passaic
was
a
tall
thin
man
with
snow
white
hair
and
a
smooth
gaunt
gloomy
face
and
the
best
funeral
air
i
have
ever
seen
edna
has
long
since
forgotten
him
she
has
an
admirable
ability
absolutely
to
forget
anything
she
may
for
whatever
reason
deem
it
inconvenient
to
remember
what
an
aid
to
conscience
is
such
a
quality
but
i
have
not
forgotten
old
weeping
willy
wheatlands
and
i
shall
not
forget
him
it
was
he
who
loaned
me
my
first
capital
the
one
that
but
i
must
not
anticipate
in
those
days
passaic
was
a
lowly
and
a
dreary
village
its
best
was
cheap
enough
its
poorest
was
wretchedly
squalid
the
seat
of
the
lorings
and
the
seat
of
the
wheatlands
stood
side
by
side
on
the
mosquito
beset
banks
of
the
river
two
dingy
frame
cottages
a
story
and
a
half
in
height
two
rooms
deep
we
lorings
had
no
money
for
my
father
was
an
honest
innocent
soul
with
a
taste
for
talking
what
he
thought
was
politics
though
in
fact
he
knew
no
more
of
the
realities
of
politics
the
game
of
pull
dick
pull
devil
for
licenses
to
fleece
a
free
proud
and
intelligent
people
he
knew
no
more
of
that
reality
than
than
the
next
honest
soul
you
may
hear
driveling
on
that
same
subject
we
had
no
money
but
weeping
willie
had
plenty
and
saved
it
blessings
on
him
i
hate
to
think
where
i
should
be
now
if
he
hadn
t
hoarded
so
while
our
straightened
way
of
living
was
compulsory
that
of
the
wheatlands
was
not
but
this
is
unimportant
the
main
point
is
both
families
lived
in
the
same
humble
way
if
i
thought
gentle
reader
had
patience
and
real
imagination
and
yes
the
real
poetic
instinct
i
should
give
her
an
inventory
of
the
furniture
of
those
two
cottages
and
of
the
meager
and
patched
draperies
of
the
two
monday
wash
lines
as
my
mother
and
edna
s
mother
and
edna
too
when
she
grew
big
enough
decorated
them
the
while
shrieking
gossip
back
and
forth
across
the
low
and
battered
board
fence
but
i
shall
not
linger
it
is
as
well
those
memories
make
me
sad
put
a
choke
in
my
throat
and
a
mist
before
my
eyes
why
if
you
can
t
guess
i
could
not
in
spoiling
ten
reams
of
paper
explain
it
to
you
one
detail
only
and
i
shall
hasten
on
both
families
lived
humbly
but
we
not
quite
so
humbly
as
the
wheatlands
family
because
my
mother
was
a
woman
of
some
neatness
and
energy
while
ma
wheatlands
was
at
or
below
the
do
easy
slattern
human
average
we
had
our
regular
saturday
bath
in
the
wash
tub
we
did
not
ever
eat
off
the
stove
and
while
we
were
patched
we
were
rarely
ragged
in
those
days
even
in
those
days
edna
was
a
scrapper
they
call
it
an
energetic
and
resolute
personality
now
it
was
called
scrappy
then
and
scrappy
it
was
when
i
would
be
chopping
wood
or
lugging
in
coal
so
occupied
that
i
did
not
dare
pause
she
would
sit
on
the
fence
in
her
faded
blue
dotted
calico
and
how
she
would
give
it
to
me
she
knew
how
to
say
the
thing
that
made
me
wild
with
the
rage
a
child
is
ashamed
to
show
yes
she
loved
to
tease
me
perhaps
really
i
hope
because
she
knew
i
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
loved
to
be
teased
by
her
to
be
noticed
in
any
way
and
mighty
pretty
she
looked
then
with
her
mop
of
yellowish
brown
hair
and
her
big
golden
brown
eyes
and
her
little
face
whose
every
feature
was
tilted
to
the
angle
that
gives
precisely
the
most
fascinating
expression
of
pretty
pertness
of
precocious
intelligence
or
of
devil
may
care
audacity
she
has
always
been
a
pretty
woman
has
edna
and
always
will
be
even
in
old
age
i
fancy
her
beauty
like
her
health
like
that
strong
supple
body
of
hers
was
built
to
last
what
is
the
matter
with
the
generations
coming
forward
now
why
do
they
bloom
only
to
wither
what
has
sapped
their
endurance
are
they
brought
up
too
soft
is
it
the
food
is
it
the
worn
out
parents
why
am
i
at
forty
younger
in
looks
and
in
strength
and
in
taste
for
life
than
the
youths
of
thirty
why
is
edna
not
five
years
my
junior
more
attractive
physically
than
girls
of
twenty
five
or
younger
but
she
was
only
eight
or
nine
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
writing
and
she
was
fond
of
me
then
really
fond
of
me
though
she
denied
it
furiously
when
the
other
children
taunted
and
though
she
was
always
jeering
at
me
calling
me
awkward
and
homely
i
don
t
think
i
was
notably
either
the
one
or
the
other
but
for
her
to
say
so
tended
to
throw
the
teasers
off
the
track
and
also
kept
me
in
humble
subjection
i
knew
she
cared
because
when
we
played
kissing
games
she
would
never
call
me
out
would
call
out
every
other
boy
but
if
i
called
any
other
girl
she
would
sulk
and
treat
me
as
badly
as
she
knew
how
also
while
she
had
nothing
but
taunts
and
sarcasms
for
me
she
was
always
to
be
found
in
the
wheatlands
back
yard
near
the
fence
or
on
it
whenever
i
was
doing
chores
in
our
back
yard
after
two
years
in
the
high
school
i
went
to
work
in
the
railway
office
as
a
sort
of
assistant
freight
clerk
she
kept
on
at
school
went
through
the
high
school
graduated
in
a
white
dress
with
blue
ribbons
and
then
sat
down
to
wait
for
a
husband
her
father
and
mother
were
sensible
people
heaven
knows
they
had
led
a
hard
enough
life
to
have
good
sense
driven
into
them
but
the
tradition
the
lady
tradition
was
too
strong
for
them
they
were
not
ashamed
to
work
themselves
they
would
have
been
both
ashamed
and
angry
had
it
been
suggested
to
them
that
their
two
boys
should
become
idlers
but
they
never
thought
of
putting
their
daughter
to
work
at
anything
after
she
graduated
and
became
a
young
lady
she
was
not
compelled
would
hardly
have
been
permitted
to
do
housework
or
sewing
you
have
seen
the
potted
flower
in
the
miserable
tenement
window
the
representative
of
the
life
that
neither
toils
nor
spins
but
simply
exists
in
idle
beauty
that
potted
bloom
concentrates
all
the
dreams
all
the
romantic
and
poetic
fancies
of
the
tenement
family
i
suppose
edna
was
some
such
treasured
exotic
possession
to
those
toil
twisted
old
parents
of
hers
they
wanted
a
flower
in
the
house
well
they
had
it
she
certainly
was
a
lovely
girl
far
too
lovely
to
be
spoiled
by
work
and
if
ever
there
was
a
scratch
or
a
stain
on
those
beautiful
white
hands
of
hers
it
assuredly
was
not
made
by
toil
she
took
music
lessons
music
lessons
how
much
of
the
ridiculous
pathetic
gropings
after
culture
is
packed
into
those
two
words
beyond
question
everyone
ought
to
know
something
about
music
we
should
all
know
something
about
everything
especially
about
the
things
that
peculiarly
stand
for
civilization
science
and
art
literature
and
the
drama
but
how
foolishly
we
are
set
at
it
instead
of
learning
to
understand
and
to
appreciate
music
we
are
taught
to
beat
the
box
in
a
feeble
clumsy
fashion
or
to
screech
or
whine
when
we
have
no
voice
worth
the
price
of
a
single
lesson
edna
took
i
don
t
know
how
many
lessons
a
week
for
i
don
t
know
how
many
years
she
learned
nothing
about
music
she
merely
learned
to
strum
on
the
piano
but
after
all
the
lessons
attained
their
real
object
they
made
edna
s
parents
and
edna
herself
and
all
the
neighbors
feel
that
she
was
indeed
a
lady
she
could
not
sew
she
could
not
cook
she
hadn
t
any
knowledge
worth
mention
of
any
practical
thing
therefore
had
no
knowledge
at
all
for
unless
knowledge
is
firmly
based
upon
and
in
the
practical
it
is
not
knowledge
but
that
worst
form
of
ignorance
misinformation
she
didn
t
know
a
thing
that
would
help
her
as
woman
wife
or
mother
but
she
could
play
the
piano
some
day
some
one
will
write
something
true
on
the
subject
of
education
you
remember
the
story
of
the
girl
from
lapland
who
applied
for
a
place
as
servant
in
new
york
and
when
they
asked
her
what
she
could
do
she
said
i
can
milk
the
reindeer
i
never
hear
the
word
education
that
i
don
t
think
of
that
girl
one
half
of
the
time
spent
at
school
to
estimate
moderately
and
nine
tenths
of
the
time
spent
in
college
class
rooms
is
given
to
things
about
as
valuable
to
a
citizen
of
this
world
as
the
lap
girl
s
education
to
a
new
york
domestic
if
anyone
tells
you
that
those
valueless
things
are
culture
tell
him
that
only
an
ignorance
still
becalmed
in
the
dense
medi
val
fog
would
talk
such
twaddle
tell
him
that
science
has
taught
us
what
common
sense
has
always
shown
that
there
is
no
beauty
divorced
from
use
that
beauty
is
simply
the
perfect
adaptation
of
the
thing
to
be
used
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
to
be
used
i
am
a
business
man
not
a
smug
shallow
pated
failure
teaching
in
an
antiquated
college
i
abhor
the
word
culture
as
i
abhor
the
word
gentleman
or
the
word
lady
because
of
the
company
into
which
it
has
fallen
so
while
i
eagerly
disclaim
any
taint
of
culture
i
insist
that
i
know
what
i
m
talking
about
when
i
talk
of
education
and
if
i
had
not
been
too
good
natured
my
girl
but
i
must
keep
to
the
story
gentle
reader
wants
a
story
he
or
she
does
not
want
to
try
to
think
it
was
pleasant
to
my
ignorant
ears
to
hear
edna
playing
sonatas
and
classical
barcaroles
and
dead
marches
and
all
manner
of
loud
and
difficult
pieces
such
sounds
issuing
from
the
humble
and
not
too
clean
wheatlands
house
gave
it
an
atmosphere
of
aristocracy
put
tone
into
the
whole
neighborhood
elevated
the
wheatlands
family
like
a
paper
collar
on
the
calico
shirt
of
a
farm
hand
if
we
look
at
ourselves
rightly
we
poor
smattering
seekers
after
a
little
showy
knowledge
of
one
kind
or
another
a
dibble
of
french
a
dabble
of
latin
or
greek
a
sputter
of
woozy
so
called
philosophy
how
like
the
paper
collared
farm
hand
we
are
how
like
the
hottentot
chief
with
a
plug
hat
atop
his
naked
brown
body
but
edna
pleased
me
fully
as
much
as
she
pleased
herself
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
i
wouldn
t
have
had
her
changed
in
the
smallest
particular
i
was
even
glad
she
could
get
rid
of
her
freckles
fascinating
little
beauty
spots
sprinkled
upon
her
tip
tilted
little
nose
she
was
not
so
fond
of
me
in
those
days
i
had
a
rival
i
am
leaning
back
and
laughing
as
i
think
of
him
charley
putney
he
was
clerk
in
a
largish
dry
goods
store
he
is
still
a
clerk
there
i
believe
and
no
doubt
is
still
the
same
cheaply
scented
heavily
pomatumed
clerkly
swell
he
was
in
the
days
when
i
feared
and
hated
him
the
store
used
to
close
at
six
o
clock
about
seven
of
summer
evenings
charley
would
issue
forth
from
his
home
to
set
the
hearts
of
the
girls
to
fluttering
they
were
all
out
waiting
down
the
street
he
would
come
with
his
hat
set
a
little
back
to
show
the
beautiful
shine
and
part
and
roach
of
his
hair
the
air
would
become
delicious
with
bergamot
occasionally
varied
by
german
cologne
or
lemon
verbena
what
a
jaunty
gay
tie
what
an
elegant
suit
and
he
wore
a
big
seal
ring
reputed
to
be
real
gold
and
such
lively
socks
down
the
street
came
charley
all
the
girls
palpitant
at
which
stoop
or
front
gate
would
he
stop
often
only
too
often
it
was
at
the
front
gate
next
ours
how
i
hated
him
and
the
cap
of
the
joke
is
that
edna
nearly
married
him
in
this
land
where
the
social
stairs
are
crowded
like
jacob
s
ladder
with
throngs
ascending
and
descending
what
a
history
it
would
make
if
the
grown
men
and
women
of
any
generation
should
tell
whom
they
almost
married
yes
edna
came
very
near
to
marrying
him
she
was
a
lady
she
did
not
know
exactly
what
that
meant
the
high
life
novels
she
read
left
her
hazy
on
the
subject
because
to
understand
any
given
thing
we
must
have
knowledge
that
enables
us
to
connect
it
with
the
things
we
already
know
a
snowball
would
be
an
unfathomable
mystery
to
a
savage
living
in
an
equatorial
plain
a
matter
of
politics
or
finance
or
sociology
or
real
art
real
literature
real
philosophy
seems
dull
and
meaningless
to
a
woman
or
to
the
average
mutton
brained
man
but
if
you
span
the
gap
between
knowledge
of
any
subject
and
a
woman
s
or
a
man
s
ignorance
of
that
subject
with
however
slender
threads
of
connecting
knowledge
she
or
he
can
at
once
bridge
it
and
begin
to
reap
the
new
fields
edna
could
not
find
any
thread
whatever
for
the
gap
between
herself
and
that
fairy
land
of
high
life
the
novels
told
her
about
in
those
days
there
was
no
high
life
in
passaic
i
suppose
there
is
now
or
at
least
passaic
thinks
there
is
and
in
purely
imaginary
matters
the
delusion
of
possession
is
equal
to
even
better
than
possession
itself
so
with
no
high
life
to
use
as
a
measure
with
only
the
instinct
that
her
white
smooth
hands
and
her
dresses
modeled
on
the
latest
paris
fashions
as
illustrated
in
the
monthly
lady
book
and
her
music
lessons
her
taste
for
what
she
then
regarded
as
literature
with
only
her
instinct
that
all
these
hallmarks
must
stamp
her
twenty
four
carat
lady
she
had
to
look
about
her
for
a
matching
gentleman
and
there
was
charley
the
one
person
within
vision
who
suggested
the
superb
heroes
of
the
high
life
novels
i
will
say
to
the
credit
of
her
good
taste
that
she
had
her
doubts
about
charley
indeed
if
his
sweet
smell
and
his
smooth
love
making
charley
excelled
as
a
love
maker
being
the
born
ladies
man
if
the
man
or
rather
the
boy
himself
had
not
won
her
heart
she
would
soon
have
tired
of
him
and
would
have
suspected
his
genuineness
as
a
truly
gentleman
but
she
fell
in
love
with
him
there
was
a
long
time
during
which
i
thought
the
reason
she
returned
to
me
or
rather
let
me
return
to
her
was
because
she
fell
out
of
love
with
him
then
there
was
a
still
longer
time
when
i
thought
the
reason
was
the
fact
that
the
very
saturday
i
got
a
raise
to
fourteen
a
week
he
fell
from
twelve
to
eight
but
latterly
i
have
known
the
truth
how
many
of
us
know
the
truth
the
down
at
the
bottom
absolute
truth
about
why
she
married
us
instead
of
the
other
fellow
very
few
i
guess
or
we
d
be
puffing
our
crops
and
flirting
our
feathers
less
cantily
she
took
up
with
me
again
because
he
dropped
her
it
was
he
that
saved
her
not
she
or
i
only
a
few
months
ago
her
old
mother
doddering
on
in
senility
with
memory
dead
except
for
early
happenings
and
these
fresh
and
vivid
said
and
when
i
think
how
nigh
edny
come
to
marryin
up
with
that
there
loud
smelling
dude
of
a
charley
putney
if
he
hadn
t
a
give
her
the
go
by
she
d
sure
a
made
a
fool
of
herself
a
wantin
me
and
her
paw
to
offer
him
money
and
a
job
in
the
undertakin
store
to
git
him
back
lawsy
me
what
a
narrer
squeak
fur
princess
edny
be
patient
gentle
reader
you
shall
soon
be
reading
things
that
will
efface
the
coarse
impression
my
old
mother
in
law
s
language
and
all
these
franknesses
about
our
beginnings
must
have
made
upon
your
refined
and
cultured
nature
swallow
a
caramel
and
be
patient
but
don
t
skip
these
pages
if
you
should
you
would
miss
the
stimulating
effect
of
contrast
not
to
speak
of
other
benefits
which
i
probably
vainly
hope
to
confer
upon
you
she
didn
t
love
me
looking
back
i
see
that
for
many
months
she
found
it
difficult
to
endure
me
but
it
was
necessary
that
she
carry
off
with
the
neighborhood
rather
than
with
me
her
pretense
of
having
cast
off
charley
because
she
preferred
me
we
can
do
wonders
in
the
way
of
concealing
wounded
pride
we
can
do
equal
wonders
in
the
way
of
preserving
a
reputation
for
unbroken
victory
and
i
believe
she
honestly
liked
me
perhaps
she
liked
me
even
more
than
she
liked
her
aromatic
charley
for
it
by
no
means
follows
that
we
like
best
where
we
love
most
i
am
loth
to
believe
i
do
not
believe
that
at
so
early
an
age
not
quite
seventeen
she
could
have
received
my
caresses
and
returned
them
with
plausibility
enough
to
deceive
me
unless
she
had
genuinely
liked
me
and
what
a
lucky
fellow
i
thought
myself
and
how
i
patronized
the
perfumed
man
and
what
a
thrashing
i
gave
him
poor
harmless
witless
creature
when
i
heard
of
his
boastings
that
he
had
dropped
edna
wheatlands
because
he
found
sally
simpson
prettier
and
more
cultured
i
must
have
been
a
railway
man
born
at
twenty
two
no
six
months
after
my
majority
i
was
jumped
into
a
head
clerkship
at
twelve
hundred
a
year
big
pay
for
a
youngster
in
those
days
not
so
bad
for
a
youngster
even
in
these
inflated
years
when
i
brought
edna
the
news
i
think
she
began
to
love
me
to
her
that
salary
was
a
halo
a
golden
halo
round
me
made
me
seem
a
superior
person
she
had
long
thought
highly
of
my
business
abilities
for
she
was
shrewd
and
had
listened
when
the
older
people
talked
and
they
were
all
for
me
as
the
likeliest
young
man
of
the
neighborhood
i
ve
had
another
raise
said
i
carelessly
we
were
sitting
on
her
front
porch
she
upon
the
top
step
i
two
steps
down
another
she
said
why
the
last
was
only
two
months
ago
yes
they
ve
pushed
me
up
to
twelve
hundred
a
year
a
little
more
for
it
s
twenty
five
per
gee
she
exclaimed
and
i
can
see
her
pretty
face
now
all
aglow
beaming
a
reverent
admiration
upon
me
i
rather
thought
i
deserved
it
but
it
has
ever
been
one
of
my
vanities
to
pretend
to
take
my
successes
as
matters
of
course
and
even
to
depreciate
them
they
say
the
english
invariably
win
in
diplomacy
because
they
act
dissatisfied
with
what
they
get
never
grumbling
so
sourly
as
when
they
capture
the
whole
hog
i
can
believe
it
that
has
been
my
policy
and
it
has
worked
rather
well
still
any
policy
works
well
if
the
man
has
the
gift
for
success
twenty
five
per
i
repeated
to
impress
it
still
more
deeply
upon
her
and
to
revel
in
the
thrilling
words
before
i
get
through
i
ll
make
them
pay
me
what
i
m
worth
do
you
think
you
ll
ever
be
making
more
than
that
exclaimed
she
wonderingly
i
ll
be
getting
two
thousand
some
day
said
i
far
more
confidently
than
i
felt
oh
godfrey
she
said
softly
and
as
i
looked
at
her
i
for
the
first
time
felt
a
certain
peculiar
thrill
that
comes
only
when
the
soul
of
the
woman
a
man
loves
rushes
forth
to
cling
to
his
soul
in
my
life
i
have
never
had
and
never
shall
have
a
happier
moment

contempt

out
of

my
pretty

advancing
her
bond
at
least
halfway
toward
meeting
mine
do
you
know
i
ve
had
an
instinct
a
presentiment
of
this
i
was
dreaming
it
when
i
woke
up
this
morning
i
ve
observed
that
every
woman
in
her
effort
to
prove
herself
not
like
other
girls
pretends
to
some
occult
or
other
equally
supranatural
quality

i
met
one
not
long
ago
who
had
several
too
many
or
too
few
skins
i
forget
which
and
as
a
result
was
endowed
with
i
cannot
recall
what
nervous
qualities
quite
peculiar
to
herself
and
somehow
most
valuable
and
fascinating
in
that
early
stage
of
her
career
my
edna
was
hipped
upon
a
rather
commonplace
personal
characteristic
the
notion
that
she
had
premonitions
was
a
sort
of
seeress
or
prophetess
later
she
dropped
it
for
one
less
tiresome
and
overworked
but
i
recall
that
even
in
that
time
of
my
deepest
infatuation
i
wished
to
hear
as
little
as
possible
about
the
occult
of
all
the
shallow
foggy
fakes
that
attract
ignorant
and
miseducated
people
the
occult
is
the
most
inexcusable
and
boring
a
great
many
people
otherwise
apparently
rather
sensible
seem
honestly
to
believe
in
it
but
being
sensible
they
don
t
have
anything
to
do
with
it
they
treat
it
as
practical
men
treat
the
idiotic
in
the
creeds
and
the
impossible
in
the
moral
codes
of
the
churches
to
which
they
belong
that
is
they
assent
and
proceed
to
dismiss
and
to
forget
however
i
was
not
much
impressed
by
edna
s
attempt
to
dazzle
me
with
her
skill
as
a
sibyl
but
i
was
deeply
impressed
by
the
awe
inspiring
softness
and
shapeliness
of
her
hand
lying
prisoner
in
mine
and
i
was
moved
to
the
uttermost
by
the
kisses
and
embraces
we
exchanged
in
the
gathering
dusk
i
love
you
she
murmured
into
my
ecstatic
ear
you
are
so
different
from
the
other
men
round
here
i
dilated
with
pride
so
far
ahead
of
them
in
every
way
ahead
of
charley
putney
said
i
jocose
but
jealous
withal
she
laughed
with
a
delightful
look
of
contemptuous
scorn
in
her
cute
face
oh
he
she
scoffed
he
s
getting
only
eight
a
week
and
he
ll
never
get
any
more
not
if
his
boss
has
sense
said
i
thinking
myself
judicial
but
let
s
talk
about
ourselves
we
can
be
married
now
i
advanced
this
timidly
for
being
a
truly
in
love
lover
i
was
a
little
afraid
of
her
a
little
uncertain
of
this
priceless
treasure
but
she
answered
promptly
yes
i
was
thinking
of
that
let
s
do
it
right
away
proposed
i
oh
not
for
several
weeks
it
wouldn
t
be
proper
why
not
she
couldn
t
explain
she
only
knew
that
there
was
something
indecent
about
haste
in
such
matters
that
the
procedure
must
be
slow
and
orderly
and
stately
we
ll
marry
the
first
of
next
month
she
finally
decided
and
i
joyfully
acquiesced
some
of
my
readers
both
of
the
gentle
and
of
the
other
kind
may
be
surprised
that
a
girl
of
seventeen
should
be
so
self
assured
so
independent
they
must
remember
that
she
was
a
daughter
of
the
people
and
among
the
people
a
girl
of
seventeen
was
and
i
suppose
still
is
ready
for
marriage
ready
and
resolved
to
decide
all
important
matters
for
herself
at
seventeen
edna
in
self
poise
and
in
experience
judgment
and
all
the
other
mature
qualities
was
the
equal
of
the
carefully
sheltered
girl
of
twenty
five
or
more
she
may
have
been
brought
up
a
lady
may
have
been
in
all
essential
ways
as
useless
as
the
most
admired
of
that
weariful
and
worthless
class
but
the
very
nature
of
her
surroundings
in
that
simple
household
and
that
simple
community
had
given
her
a
certain
practical
education
and
i
may
say
here
that
to
it
she
owes
all
she
is
to
day
do
not
forget
this
gentle
reader
as
you
read
about
her
and
as
she
dazzles
you
as
you
look
at
the
gorgeous
hardy
rose
do
not
forget
that
such
spring
only
from
the
soil
develop
only
in
the
open
that
very
evening
we
began
to
look
for
a
home
as
soon
as
we
were
outside
her
front
gate
she
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
better
part
of
the
town
nor
did
she
pause
or
so
much
as
glance
at
a
house
until
we
were
clear
of
the
neighborhood
in
which
we
had
always
lived
and
were
among
houses
much
superior
i
admired
and
i
still
admire
this
significant
move
of
hers
it
was
the
gesture
of
progress
of
ambition
it
was
splendidly
american
i
myself
should
have
been
content
to
settle
down
near
our
fathers
and
mothers
among
the
people
we
knew
i
should
no
doubt
have
been
better
satisfied
to
keep
up
the
mode
of
living
to
which
we
had
been
used
all
our
lives
the
time
would
have
come
when
i
should
have
reached
out
for
more
comfort
and
for
luxury
but
it
was
natural
that
she
should
develop
in
this
direction
before
i
did
she
had
read
her
novels
and
her
magazines
had
the
cultured
woman
s
innate
fondness
for
dress
and
show
had
had
nothing
but
those
kinds
of
things
to
think
about
i
had
been
too
busy
trying
to
make
money
to
have
any
time
for
getting
ideas
about
spending
it
no
while
her
motive
in
seeking
better
things
than
we
had
known
was
in
the
main
a
vanity
and
a
sham
her
action
had
as
much
initial
good
in
it
as
if
her
motive
had
been
sensible
and
helpful
and
back
of
the
motive
lay
an
instinct
for
getting
up
in
the
world
that
has
been
the
redeeming
and
preserving
trait
in
her
character
it
was
this
instinct
that
ought
to
have
made
her
the
fit
wife
for
an
ambitious
and
advancing
man
you
will
presently
see
how
this
fine
and
useful
instinct
was
perverted
by
vanity
and
false
education
and
the
pernicious
example
of
other
women
the
rents
are
much
higher
in
this
neighborhood
said
i
with
a
doubtful
but
admiring
look
round
at
the
pretty
houses
and
their
well
ordered
grounds
of
course
said
she
but
maybe
we
can
find
something
anyway
it
won
t
do
any
harm
to
look
no
indeed
i
assented
for
i
liked
the
idea
myself
this
better
neighborhood
looked
more
like
her
than
her
own
seemed
to
her
lover
s
eyes
exactly
suited
to
her
beauty
and
her
stylishness
for
the
lady
book
was
teaching
her
to
make
herself
far
more
attractive
to
the
eye
than
were
the
other
girls
over
in
our
part
of
town
i
still
puzzle
at
why
charley
putney
gave
her
up
the
only
plausible
theory
seems
to
be
that
she
was
so
sick
in
love
with
him
that
she
wearied
him
the
most
attractive
girl
in
the
world
if
she
dotes
on
a
young
man
too
ardently
will
turn
his
stomach
and
alarm
his
delicate
sense
of
feminine
propriety
as
we
walked
on
she
with
an
elate
and
proud
air
she
said
how
different
it
smells
over
here
at
first
i
didn
t
understand
what
she
meant
but
as
i
thought
of
her
remark
the
meaning
came
and
i
believe
that
was
the
beginning
of
my
dissatisfaction
with
what
i
had
all
my
life
had
in
the
way
of
surroundings
i
have
since
observed
that
the
sense
of
smell
is
blunt
is
almost
latent
in
people
of
the
lower
orders
and
that
it
becomes
more
acute
and
more
sensitive
as
we
ascend
in
the
social
scale
up
to
that
time
my
ambition
to
rise
had
been
rather
indefinite
a
desire
to
make
money
which
everyone
seemed
to
think
was
the
highest
aim
in
life
and
also
an
instinct
to
beat
the
other
fellows
working
with
me
now
it
became
definite
i
began
to
smell
i
wanted
to
get
away
from
unpleasant
smells
i
do
not
mean
that
this
was
a
resolution
all
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
i
simply
mean
that
as
everything
must
have
a
beginning
that
remark
of
hers
was
for
me
the
beginning
of
a
long
and
slow
but
steady
process
of
what
may
be
called
civilizing
presently
she
said
if
we
couldn
t
afford
a
house
we
might
take
one
of
the
flats
but
i
m
afraid
you
d
be
lonesome
away
off
from
everybody
we
know
she
tossed
her
head
a
good
lonesome
said
she
i
m
tired
of
common
people
i
was
reading
about
reincarnations
the
other
day
good
lord
laughed
i
what
are
they
she
explained
as
well
as
she
could
probably
as
well
as
anybody
could
i
admired
her
learning
but
the
thing
itself
did
not
interest
me
i
guess
there
must
be
something
in
it
she
went
on
i
m
sure
in
a
former
life
i
was
something
a
lot
different
from
what
i
am
now
oh
you
re
all
right
i
assured
her
putting
my
arm
round
her
in
the
friendly
darkness
of
a
row
of
sidewalk
elms
when
we
had
indulged
in
an
interlude
of
love
making
she
returned
to
the
original
subject
i
wonder
how
much
rent
we
could
afford
to
pay
said
she
they
say
the
rent
ought
never
to
be
more
per
month
than
the
income
is
per
week
then
we
could
pay
twenty
five
a
month
that
seemed
to
me
a
lot
to
pay
and
indeed
it
was
but
she
did
not
inherit
weeping
willie
s
tightness
and
she
had
never
had
money
to
spend
or
any
training
in
either
making
or
spending
money
that
is
to
say
she
was
precisely
as
ignorant
of
the
main
business
of
life
as
is
the
rest
of
american
womanhood
under
our
ridiculous
system
of
education
so
twenty
five
dollars
a
month
rent
meant
nothing
to
her
we
can
t
do
anything
to
night
said
she
but
i
ve
got
my
days
free
and
i
ll
look
at
different
places
and
when
i
find
several
to
choose
from
we
can
come
in
the
evening
or
on
sunday
and
decide
this
suited
me
exactly
we
dismissed
the
matter
hunted
out
a
shady
nook
and
sat
down
to
enjoy
ourselves
after
the
manner
of
young
lovers
on
a
fine
night
never
before
had
she
given
herself
freely
to
love
i
know
now
it
was
because
never
before
had
she
loved
me
i
was
deliriously
happy
that
night
and
i
am
sure
she
was
too
she
no
less
than
i
had
the
ardent
temperament
that
goes
with
the
ambitious
nature
and
now
that
she
was
idealizing
me
into
the
man
who
could
lead
her
to
the
fairy
lands
she
dreamed
of
she
gave
me
her
whole
heart
it
was
the
beginning
of
what
was
beyond
question
the
happiest
period
of
both
our
lives
i
have
a
dim
old
photograph
of
us
two
taken
about
that
time
at
a
glance
you
see
it
is
the
picture
of
two
young
people
of
the
working
class
two
green
unformed
creatures
badly
dressed
and
gawkily
self
conscious
but
there
is
a
look
in
her
face
and
in
mine
to
be
quite
honest
i
m
glad
i
don
t
look
like
that
now
i
wouldn
t
go
back
if
i
could
nevertheless
how
we
loved
each
other
and
how
happy
we
were
i
feel
that
i
weary
you
gentle
reader
there
is
in
my
sentiment
too
much
about
wages
and
flat
rents
and
the
smells
that
come
from
people
who
work
hard
and
live
in
poor
places
and
eat
badly
cooked
strong
food
but
that
is
not
my
fault
it
is
life
and
if
you
believe
that
your
and
your
romancers
tawdry
imaginings
are
better
than
life
well
you
may
not
be
so
wise
or
so
exalted
as
you
fancy
the
upshot
of
our
inspecting
places
to
live
and
haggling
over
prices
was
that
we
took
a
flat
in
the
best
quarter
of
passaic
the
top
and
in
those
elevatorless
days
the
cheapest
flat
in
the
house
we
were
to
pay
forty
dollars
a
month
a
stiff
rent
that
caused
excitement
in
our
neighborhood
and
set
my
mother
and
her
father
to
denouncing
us
as
a
pair
of
fools
bent
upon
ruin
i
thought
so
myself
but
i
could
have
denied
edna
nothing
at
that
time
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
by
working
harder
than
ever
at
the
railway
office
i
would
compel
another
raise
when
i
told
my
mother
about
this
secret
resolve
of
mine
she
said
if
you
do
get
more
money
godfrey
don
t
tell
edna
she
s
a
fool
she
ll
keep
your
nose
to
the
grindstone
all
your
life
if
you
ain
t
careful
it
takes
a
better
money
maker
than
you
re
likely
to
be
to
hold
up
against
that
kind
of
a
woman
oh
she
s
like
all
girls
said
i
that
s
just
it
replied
my
mother
that
s
why
i
ain
t
got
no
use
for
women
look
what
poor
managers
they
are
look
how
they
idle
and
waste
and
run
into
debt
but
there
s
a
lot
to
be
said
against
the
men
too
saloons
for
instance
and
talkin
politics
with
loafers
said
my
father
s
wife
bitterly
i
guess
the
trouble
with
men
and
women
is
they
re
too
human
said
i
who
had
inherited
something
of
the
philosopher
from
my
father
and
mother
a
man
s
got
to
get
married
and
he
s
got
to
marry
a
woman
yes
i
suppose
he
has
she
grudgingly
assented
mighty
poor
providers
most
of
the
men
is
and
mighty
poor
use
the
women
make
of
what
little
the
men
brings
home
but
about
you
and
edny
wheatlands
you
ought
to
do
better
n
her
godfrey
you
re
caught
by
her
looks
and
her
style
and
her
education
none
of
them
things
makes
a
good
wife
i
certainly
wouldn
t
marry
a
girl
that
didn
t
have
them
all
three
but
there
s
something
more
insisted
mother
one
woman
can
t
have
everything
said
i
no
but
she
can
have
what
i
mean
and
she
s
not
much
good
to
a
man
without
it
if
you
re
set
on
marrying
her
wait
till
you
re
ready
anyhow
she
never
will
be
what
do
you
mean
mother
wait
till
you
ve
got
money
in
the
savings
bank
wait
till
you
ve
got
used
to
having
money
then
maybe
you
ll
be
able
to
put
a
bit
on
a
spendthrift
wife
even
if
you
are
crazy
about
her
you
re
making
a
wrong
start
with
her
godfrey
you
re
giving
her
the
upper
hand
and
that
s
bad
for
women
like
her
mighty
bad
it
was
from
my
mother
that
i
get
my
ability
at
business
she
and
i
often
had
sensible
talks
and
her
advice
started
me
right
in
the
railroad
office
and
kept
me
right
until
i
knew
my
way
so
i
did
not
become
angry
at
her
plain
speaking
but
appreciated
its
good
sense
even
though
i
thought
her
prejudiced
against
my
edna
however
i
had
not
the
least
impulse
to
put
off
the
marriage
my
one
wish
was
to
hasten
it
never
before
or
since
was
time
so
leisurely
but
the
day
dragged
itself
up
at
last
and
we
were
married
in
church
at
what
seemed
to
us
then
enormous
expense
there
was
a
dinner
afterward
at
which
everyone
ate
and
drank
too
much
a
coarse
and
common
scene
which
i
will
spare
gentle
reader
edna
and
i
went
up
to
new
york
city
for
a
friday
to
monday
honeymoon
but
we
were
back
to
spend
sunday
night
in
our
grand
forty
dollar
flat
on
monday
morning
i
went
to
work
again
a
married
man
an
important
person
in
the
community
never
has
any
height
i
have
attained
or
seen
since
equalled
the
grandeur
of
that
forty
dollar
flat
my
common
sense
tells
me
that
it
was
a
small
and
poor
affair
i
remember
for
example
that
the
bathroom
was
hardly
big
enough
to
turn
round
in
i
recall
that
i
have
sat
by
the
window
in
the
parlor
and
without
rising
have
reached
a
paper
on
a
table
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
but
these
hard
facts
in
no
way
interfere
with
or
correct
the
flat
as
my
imagination
persists
in
picturing
it
what
vistas
of
rooms
what
high
ceilings
what
woodwork
and
plumbing
and
what
magnificent
furniture
edna
s
father
in
a
moment
of
generosity
told
her
he
would
pay
for
the
outfitting
of
the
household
and
being
in
the
undertaking
business
he
could
get
discounts
on
furniture
and
even
on
kitchen
utensils
edna
did
the
selecting
i
thought
everything
wonderful
and
as
i
have
said
my
imagination
refuses
to
recreate
the
place
as
it
actually
was
but
i
recall
that
there
was
a
brave
show
of
red
and
of
plush
and
we
all
know
what
that
means
whether
her
lady
book
had
miseducated
her
or
her
untrained
eyes
excited
by
the
gaudiness
she
saw
when
she
went
shopping
had
beguiled
her
from
the
counsels
of
the
lady
book
i
do
not
know
but
i
am
sure
as
i
recall
red
and
plush
that
our
first
home
was
the
typical
horror
inhabited
by
the
extravagant
working
class
family
no
matter
there
we
were
in
arcadia
for
a
time
her
restless
soaring
fancy
wearied
perhaps
by
its
audacious
flight
to
this
lofty
perch
of
red
and
plush
and
forty
dollars
a
month
folded
its
wings
and
was
content
for
a
time
her
pride
and
satisfaction
in
the
luxurious
newness
overcame
her
distaste
and
disdain
and
moved
her
to
keep
things
spotless
i
recall
the
perfume
of
cleanness
that
used
to
delight
my
nostrils
at
my
evening
homecoming
and
then
the
intoxicating
perfume
of
edna
herself
the
aroma
of
healthy
young
feminine
beauty
we
loved
each
other
simply
passionately
in
the
old
fashioned
way
with
the
growth
of
intelligence
with
the
realization
on
the
part
of
men
that
her
keep
is
a
large
part
of
the
reason
in
the
woman
s
mind
if
not
in
her
heart
for
marrying
and
loving
there
has
come
a
decline
and
decay
of
the
former
reverence
and
awe
of
man
toward
woman
also
the
men
nowadays
know
more
about
the
mystery
of
woman
know
everything
about
it
where
not
so
many
years
ago
a
pure
woman
was
to
a
man
a
real
religious
mystery
her
physical
being
the
clothes
she
wore
underneath
the
supposedly
sweet
and
clean
thoughts
nobler
than
his
that
dwelt
in
the
temple
of
her
soul
these
things
surrounded
a
girl
with
an
atmosphere
of
thrilling
enigma
for
the
youth
who
won
from
her
lips
and
from
the
church
the
right
to
explore
all
that
has
passed
or
almost
passed
i
am
one
of
those
who
believe
that
what
has
come
or
rather
is
coming
to
take
its
place
is
better
finer
nobler
but
the
old
order
had
its
charm
what
a
charm
for
me
who
had
never
known
any
woman
well
who
had
dreamed
of
her
passionately
but
purely
and
respectfully
there
was
much
of
pain
of
shyness
fear
of
offending
her
higher
nature
uneasiness
lest
i
should
be
condemned
and
cast
out
in
those
early
days
of
married
life
but
it
was
a
sweet
sort
of
pain
and
when
we
began
to
understand
each
other
to
be
human
though
still
on
our
best
behavior
when
we
found
that
we
were
congenial
were
happy
together
in
ways
undreamed
of
life
seemed
to
be
paying
not
like
the
bankrupt
it
usually
is
when
the
time
for
redeeming
its
promises
comes
but
like
a
benevolent
prodigal
like
a
lottery
whose
numbers
all
draw
capital
prizes
i
admit
the
truth
of
much
the
pessimists
have
to
say
against
life
but
one
thing
i
must
grant
it
when
in
its
rare
generous
moments
it
relents
it
does
know
how
to
play
the
host
at
the
feast
how
to
spread
the
board
how
to
fill
the
flagons
and
to
keep
them
filled
how
to
scatter
the
wreaths
and
the
garlands
how
to
select
the
singers
and
the
dancers
who
help
the
banqueters
make
merry
when
i
remember
my
honeymoon
i
almost
forgive
you
life
for
the
shabby
tricks
you
have
played
me
now
i
can
conceive
a
honeymoon
that
would
last
on
and
on
not
in
the
glory
and
feverish
joy
of
its
first
period
but
in
a
substantial
and
satisfying
human
happiness
but
not
a
honeymoon
with
a
wife
who
is
no
more
fitted
to
be
a
wife
than
the
office
boy
is
fitted
to

job
patience
gentle
reader
i
know
how
this
sudden
shriek
of
discord
across
the
amorous
strains
of
the
honeymoon
music
must
have
jarred
your
nerves
but
be
patient
and
i
will
explain
except
ourselves
every
other
family
in
the
house
in
the
neighborhood
had
at
least
one
servant
we
had
none
if
edna
had
been
at
all
economical
we
might
have
kept
a
cook
and
pinched
along
but
edna
spent
carelessly
all
the
money
i
gave
her
and
i
gave
her
all
there
was
a
large
part
of
it
went
for
finery
for
her
personal
adornment
trash
of
which
she
soon
tired
much
of
it
she
disliked
as
soon
as
it
came
home
and
she
tried
it
on
without
the
saleslady
to
flatter
and
confuse
i
in
a
good
natured
way
for
i
really
felt
perfectly
good
humored
about
it
remonstrated
with
her
for
letting
everybody
rob
her
for
getting
so
little
for
her
money
she
took
high
ground
such
things
were
beneath
her
attention
if
i
had
wanted
a
wife
of
that
dull
pinch
penny
kind
i
d
certainly
not
have
married
her
a
talented
educated
woman
bent
on
improving
her
mind
and
her
position
in
the
world
and
that
seemed
reasonable
still
the
money
was
going
the
bills
were
piling
up
and
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
and
she
did
the
cooking
i
think
i
have
already
said
that
she
had
not
learned
to
cook
how
she
and
her
mother
expected
her
to
get
along
as
a
poor
clerk
s
wife
i
can
t
imagine
the
worst
of
it
was
she
believed
she
could
cook
that
is
the
way
with
women
they
look
down
on
housekeeping
on
the
practical
side
of
life
as
too
coarse
and
low
to
be
worthy
their
attention
they
say
all
that
sort
of
thing
is
easy
is
like
the
toil
of
a
day
laborer
they
say
anybody
could
do
it
and
they
really
believe
so
men
no
matter
how
high
their
position
weary
and
bore
themselves
every
day
because
they
must
with
routine
tasks
beside
which
dishwashing
has
charm
and
variety
yet
women
shirk
their
proper
and
necessary
share
of
life
s
burden
pretending
that
it
is
beneath
them
edna
typical
woman
thought
she
could
cook
and
keep
house
because
she
so
superior
could
certainly
do
inferior
work
if
she
chose
but
after
that
first
brief
spurt
of
enthusiasm
of
daily
conference
with
the
lady
book
s
complete
housekeeper
s
guide
the
flat
was
badly
kept
was
really
horribly
kept
was
worse
than
either
her
home
or
mine
before
we
had
been
living
there
many
months
it
took
on
much
the
same
odor
it
looked
worse
as
tawdry
finery
when
mussy
and
dirty
is
more
repulsive
than
a
plain
toilet
gone
back
i
did
not
especially
mind
that
but
her
cooking
i
had
not
been
accustomed
to
anything
especially
good
in
the
way
of
cooking
mother
was
the
old
fashioned
fryer
and
you
know
those
fryers
always
served
the
vegetables
soggy
i
could
have
eaten
exceedingly
poor
stuff
without
complaining
or
feeling
like
complaining
but
the
stuff
she
was
soon
flinging
angrily
upon
the
slovenly
table
i
could
not
eat
she
ate
it
enough
of
it
to
keep
alive
and
it
didn
t
seem
to
do
her
any
harm
how
many
women
have
you
known
who
were
judges
of
things
to
eat
do
you
understand
how
women
continue
to
eat
the
messes
they
put
into
their
pretty
mouths
and
keep
alive
i
could
not
eat
edna
s
cooking
i
ate
bread
cold
meats
and
the
like
from
the
delicatessen
shop
when
the
meal
happened
to
be
of
her
own
preparing
i
dropped
into
the
habit
of
slipping
away
after
a
pretense
at
eating
to
get
breakfast
or
dinner
or
supper
in
a
restaurant
the
cheapest
kind
of
restaurant
but
i
ate
there
with
relish
and
never
once
did
i
murmur
to
edna
i
loved
her
too
well
also
i
am
by
nature
a
tolerant
even
tempered
person
hating
strife
avoiding
the
harsh
word
in
fact
my
timidity
in
that
respect
has
been
my
chief
weakness
has
cost
me
dear
again
and
again
but
after
ten
months
of
married
life
edna
fell
ill
all
you
married
men
will
prick
up
your
ears
at
that
why
is
it
that
bread
winners
somehow
contrive
to
keep
on
their
feet
most
of
the
time
little
though
they
know
as
to
caring
for
their
health
reckless
though
they
are
in
eating
and
drinking
why
is
it
that
married
women
unless
they
have
to
work
spend
so
much
time
in
sick
bed
or
near
it
they
say
we
in
america
have
more
than
nine
times
as
many
doctors
proportionately
to
population
as
any
other
country
the
doctors
live
off
of
our
women
our
idle
overeating
lazy
women
who
will
not
work
who
will
not
walk
who
are
always
getting
something
the
matter
with
them
of
course
the
doctors
parasites
upon
parasites
fake
up
all
kinds
of
lies
many
of
them
malicious
slanders
against
the
husbands
to
excuse
their
patients
and
to
keep
them
patients
but
what
is
the
truth
edna
who
read
all
the
time
she
was
not
plotting
to
get
acquainted
with
our
neighbors
they
looked
down
upon
us
and
wished
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
us
edna
who
ate
quantities
of
candy
between
meals
and
ate
at
meals
rich
things
she
bought
of
confectioners
and
bakers
edna
fell
ill
and
frightened
me
almost
out
of
my
senses
i
understand
it
now
but
i
did
not
understand
then
i
believed
as
do
all
ignorant
people
both
the
obviously
ignorant
and
the
ignorant
who
pass
for
enlightened
i
believed
sickness
to
be
a
mysterious
accident
like
earthquakes
and
lightning
strokes
a
hit
or
miss
blow
from
nowhere
in
particular
so
i
was
all
sympathy
and
terror
she
got
well
she
looked
as
well
as
ever
but
she
said
she
was
not
strong
and
godfrey
we
simply
have
got
to
keep
a
girl
i
ve
borne
up
bravely
but
i
can
t
stand
it
any
longer
you
see
for
yourself
the
rough
work
and
the
strain
of
housekeeping
are
too
much
for
me
very
well
said
i
the
bills
including
the
doctor
s
and
drug
bills
were
piling
up
we
were
more
than
a
thousand
dollars
in
debt
but
i
said
very
well
you
are
right
we
men
do
not
realize
that
there
are
two
distinct
and
equal
expressions
of
strength
the
strength
of
bulk
that
is
often
deceptive
in
that
it
looks
stronger
than
it
is
the
strength
of
fiber
that
is
always
deceptive
in
that
it
is
stronger
than
it
looks
in
a
general
way
man
has
the
strength
of
bulk
woman
the
strength
of
fiber
so
man
looks
on
woman
s
appearance
of
fragility
and
fancies
her
weak
and
himself
the
stronger
i
looked
at
edna
and
said
very
well
we
must
have
a
girl
to
help
i
shan
t
linger
upon
this
part
of
my
story
i
am
tempted
to
linger
but
after
all
it
is
the
commonplace
of
american
life
familiar
to
all
though
understood
apparently
by
only
a
few
why
do
more
than
ninety
per
cent
of
our
small
business
men
fail
why
are
the
savings
banks
accounts
of
our
working
classes
a
mere
fraction
of
those
of
the
working
classes
of
other
countries
and
so
on
and
so
on
but
i
see
your
impatience
gentle
reader
with
these
matters
so
inartistic
we
sank
deeper
and
deeper
in
debt
edna
s
health
did
not
improve
the
girl
we
hired
had
lived
with
better
class
people
she
despised
us
shirked
her
work
and
edna
did
not
know
how
to
manage
her
if
the
head
of
the
household
is
incompetent
and
indifferent
a
servant
only
aggravates
the
mess
and
the
more
servants
the
greater
the
mess
all
edna
s
interest
was
for
her
music
her
novels
her
social
advancement
and
her
dreams
of
being
a
grand
lady
these
dreams
had
returned
with
increased
power
they
took
complete
possession
of
her
they
soured
her
disposition
made
her
irritable
usually
blue
or
cross
only
at
long
intervals
loving
and
sweet
no
perhaps
the
dreams
were
not
responsible
perhaps
probably
the
real
cause
was
the
upset
state
of
her
health
through
the
absurd
idle
life
she
led
idle
and
lonely
for
she
would
not
go
with
whom
she
could
she
could
not
go
with
whom
she
would
i
m
sick
of
sitting
alone
said
she
no
wonder
i
can
t
get
well
let
s
go
back
near
the
old
folks
suggested
i
our
friends
won
t
come
to
see
us
in
this
part
of
the
town
they
feel
uncomfortable
i
should
think
they
would
cried
she
and
if
they
came
i
d
see
to
it
that
they
were
so
uncomfortable
that
they
would
never
come
again
i
worked
hard
my
salary
went
up
to
fifteen
hundred
to
two
thousand
to
twenty
five
hundred
now
said
edna
perhaps
you
ll
get
hands
that
won
t
look
like
a
laboring
man
s
how
can
i
hope
to
make
nice
friends
when
i
ve
a
husband
with
broken
finger
nails
our
expenses
continued
to
outrun
my
salary
but
i
was
not
especially
worried
for
i
began
to
realize
that
i
had
the
money
making
talent
three
children
were
born
only
the
first
margot
lived
looking
back
upon
those
six
years
of
our
married
life
i
see
after
the
first
year
only
a
confused
repellent
mess
of
illness
nurses
death
doctors
quarrels
with
servants
untidy
rooms
and
clothes
slovenly
peevish
wife
with
myself
watching
it
all
in
a
dazed
helpless
way
thinking
it
must
be
the
normal
natural
order
of
domestic
life
which
indeed
it
is
in
america
and
wondering
where
and
how
it
was
to
end
i
recall
going
home
one
afternoon
late
to
find
edna
yawning
listlessly
over
some
book
in
a
magazine
culture
series
her
hair
hung
every
which
way
her
wrapper
was
torn
and
stained
her
skin
had
the
musty
look
that
suggests
unpleasant
conditions
both
without
and
within
margot
dirty
pimply
from
too
much
candy
sat
on
the
floor
squalling
take
the
child
away
cried
edna
at
sight
of
me
i
thought
you
d
never
come
a
little
more
of
this
and
i
ll
kill
myself
what
is
there
to
live
for
anyhow
silent
and
depressed
i
took
margot
for
a
walk
and
as
i
wandered
along
sadly
i
was
full
of
pity
for
edna
and
felt
that
somehow
the
blame
was
wholly
mine
for
the
wretched
plight
of
our
home
life
when
i
was
twenty
eight
and
edna
twenty
three
i
had
a
series
of
rapid
promotions
which
landed
me
in
new
york
in
the
position
of
assistant
traffic
superintendent
my
salary
was
eight
thousand
a
year
it
so
happened
coincidence
and
nothing
else
that
those
eighteen
months
of
quick
advance
for
me
also
marked
a
notable
change
in
edna
there
are
some
people
many
people
so
obsessed
of
the
know
it
all
vanity
that
they
can
learn
nothing
nor
are
all
these
people
preachers
doctors
and
teachers
gentle
reader
then
there
is
another
species
who
pretend
to
know
all
who
are
chary
of
admitting
to
learning
or
needing
to
learn
anything
however
small
yet
who
behind
their
pretense
toil
at
improving
themselves
as
a
hungry
mouse
gnaws
at
the
wall
of
the
cheese
box
of
this
species
was
edna
as
she
was
fond
of
being
mysterious
about
her
thoughts
and
intentions
she
never
told
me
what
set
her
going
again
after
that
long
lethargy
perhaps
it
was
some
woman
whom
she
had
a
sudden
opportunity
thoroughly
to
study
some
woman
who
knew
and
lived
the
ideas
edna
had
groped
for
in
vain
perhaps
it
was
a
novel
she
read
or
articles
in
her
magazines
it
doesn
t
matter
i
never
asked
her
i
had
learned
that
wild
horses
would
not
drag
from
her
a
confession
of
where
she
had
got
an
idea
because
such
a
confession
would
to
her
notion
detract
from
her
own
glory
however
the
essential
fact
is
that
she
suddenly
roused
and
set
to
work
as
she
had
never
worked
before
went
at
it
like
a
prospector
who
after
toiling
now
hard
and
now
discouragedly
for
years
strikes
by
accident
a
rich
vein
of
gold
edna
showed
in
every
move
that
she
not
hoped
not
believed
but
knew
she
was
at
last
on
the
right
track
she
began
to
take
care
scrupulous
care
of
her
person
the
minute
intelligent
care
she
has
ever
since
been
expanding
and
improving
upon
has
never
since
relaxed
and
never
will
relax
also
she
began
to
plan
and
to
move
definitely
in
the
matter
of
taking
care
of
margot
to
look
after
her
speech
her
manners
her
food
her
person
especially
perhaps
the
last
margot
s
teeth
margot
s
hair
margot
s
walk
margot
s
feet
and
hands
and
skin
the
shape
of
her
nose
the
set
of
her
ears
all
these
things
she
talked
about
and
fussed
with
as
agitatedly
as
about
her
own
self
edna
became
a
crank
on
the
subject
of
food
what
is
called
a
crank
by
the
unthinking
of
whom
by
the
way
i
was
to
my
lasting
regret
one
until
a
few
years
ago
for
a
year
or
two
her
moves
in
this
important
direction
were
blundering
intermittent
and
not
always
successful
small
wonder
when
there
is
really
no
reliable
information
to
be
had
the
scientists
being
uncertain
and
the
doctors
grossly
ignorant
but
gradually
she
evolved
and
lived
upon
a
beauty
diet
margot
of
course
had
to
do
the
same
she
took
exercises
morning
and
night
took
long
and
regular
walks
for
the
figure
and
skin
and
to
put
clearness
and
brightness
into
the
eyes
i
believe
she
and
margot
with
occasional
lapses
keep
up
their
regimen
to
this
day
the
house
was
as
slattern
as
ever
the
diet
and
comfort
and
health
of
the
family
bread
winner
were
no
more
the
subject
of
thought
and
care
than
well
than
the
next
husband
s
to
his
wife
she
gave
some
attention
intelligent
and
valuable
attention
i
cheerfully
concede
to
improving
my
speech
manners
and
dress
but
beyond
that
the
revolution
affected
only
her
and
her
daughter
them
it
affected
amazingly
in
three
or
four
months
the
change
in
their
appearance
was
literally
beyond
belief
edna
s
beauty
and
style
came
back
no
burst
forth
in
an
entirely
new
kind
of
radiance
and
fascination
as
for
little
margot
she
transformed
from
homeliness
from
the
scrawny
pasty
look
of
bad
health
from
bad
temper
into
as
neat
and
sweet
and
pretty
a
little
lady
as
could
be
found
anywhere
you
gentle
reader
who
are
ever
ready
to
slop
over
with
some
kind
of
sentimentality
because
in
your
shallowness
you
regard
sentimentality
not
sentiment
for
of
that
you
know
nothing
but
sentimentality
as
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
just
as
a
child
regards
sickeningly
rich
cake
as
the
finest
food
in
the
world
you
gentle
reader
have
already
made
up
your
mind
why
edna
thus
suddenly
awakened
or
rather
reawakened
aha
you
are
saying
served
him
good
and
right
she
found
some
one
who
appreciated
her
that
guess
of
yours
shows
how
little
you
know
about
edna
or
the
edna
kind
of
human
being
the
people
who
do
things
in
this
world
except
in
our
foolish
american
novels
do
because
they
must
they
may
do
better
or
worse
under
the
influence
of
love
which
is
full
as
often
a
drag
as
a
spur
but
they
do
not
do
because
of
love
i
shall
not
argue
this
i
shrink
from
gratuitously
inviting
an
additional
vial
of
wrath
from
the
ladies
who
resent
being
told
how
worthless
they
in
their
indolence
and
self
complacence
permit
themselves
to
be
and
how
small
a
positive
part
they
now
play
in
the
world
drama
i
should
have
said
nothing
at
all
about
the
matter
were
it
not
that
i
wish
to
be
strictly
just
to
edna
and
she
being
wholly
the
ambitious
woman
has
always
had
and
still
has
a
deep
horror
of
scandal
intrigue
irregularity
and
unconventionality
of
every
sort
it
was
necessary
that
we
move
to
a
place
more
convenient
to
my
business
headquarters
in
new
york
city
a
few
weeks
after
i
got
the
eight
thousand
a
year
edna
and
little
margot
and
i
went
to
brooklyn
to
live
took
a
really
charming
house
in
bedford
avenue
with
large
grounds
around
it
and
once
more
we
were
happy
it
seemed
to
me
we
had
started
afresh
and
we
had
ii
why
did
we
go
to
brooklyn
by
the
time
edna
and
i
had
been
married
six
years
i
learned
many
things
about
her
inmost
self
i
was
not
at
all
analytic
or
critical
as
to
matters
at
home
i
used
my
intelligence
in
my
own
business
i
assumed
that
my
wife
had
intelligence
and
that
she
used
it
in
her
business
her
part
of
our
joint
business
i
believed
the
reason
her
part
of
it
went
badly
was
solely
the
natural
conditions
of
life
beyond
her
control
a
railroad
a
factory
could
be
run
smoothly
a
family
and
a
household
were
different
matters
and
i
admired
my
wife
as
much
as
i
loved
her
and
regarded
her
as
a
wonderful
woman
which
indeed
in
certain
respects
she
was
but
i
had
discovered
in
her
several
weaknesses
some
of
these
i
knew
others
i
did
not
permit
myself
to
know
that
i
knew
for
example
i
was
perfectly
aware
that
she
was
not
so
truthful
as
one
might
be
but
i
did
not
let
myself
admit
that
she
was
not
always
unconscious
of
her
own
deviations
from
the
truth
i
had
gained
enough
experience
of
life
to
learn
that
lying
is
practically
a
universal
weakness
so
i
did
not
especially
mind
it
in
her
often
found
it
amusing
i
had
not
then
waked
up
to
the
fact
that
as
a
rule
women
systematically
lie
to
their
husbands
about
big
things
and
little
and
that
those
women
who
profess
to
be
too
proud
to
lie
do
their
lying
by
indirections
such
as
omissions
half
truths
and
misleading
silences
i
am
not
criticising
self
respect
real
personal
pride
i
have
discovered
in
spite
of
the
reading
matter
of
all
kinds
about
the
past
is
a
modern
development
is
still
in
embryo
and
those
of
us
who
profess
to
be
the
proudest
are
either
the
most
ignorant
of
ourselves
or
the
most
hypocritical
but
back
to
my
acquaintance
with
my
wife
s
character
when
i
told
her
we
should
have
to
live
nearer
my
work
my
new
work
than
passaic
she
promptly
said
let
s
go
to
brooklyn
why
not
to
new
york
said
i
at
least
until
i
get
thoroughly
trained
i
want
to
be
close
to
the
office
but
there
s
margot
said
she
margot
must
have
a
place
to
play
in
and
we
couldn
t
afford
such
a
place
in
new
york
i
can
t
let
her
run
about
the
streets
or
go
to
public
schools
she
d
pick
up
all
sorts
of
low
coarse
associates
and
habits
then
let
s
go
to
some
town
opposite
across
the
hudson
if
we
can
t
live
on
manhattan
island
and
i
think
you
re
right
about
margot
why
let
s
live
where
living
is
cheap
we
ought
to
be
saving
some
money
i
hate
these
jersey
towns
said
edna
petulantly
i
don
t
think
margot
would
get
the
right
sort
of
social
influences
in
them
as
soon
as
she
said
social
influences
i
should
have
understood
the
whole
business
the
only
person
higher
up
on
the
social
ladder
with
whom
edna
had
been
able
to
scrape
intimate
acquaintance
in
passaic
was
a
dowdy
tawdry
chatterbox
of
a
woman
i
forget
her
name
who
talked
incessantly
of
the
fashionable
people
she
knew
in
brooklyn
how
she
had
gone
there
a
stranger
had
joined
st
mary
s
episcopal
church
and
had
at
once
become
a
social
favorite
invited
to
the
very
best
houses
my
dear
such
lovely
homes
and
associated
with
the
most
charming
cultured
people
and
so
on
and
on
you
know
the
rest
of
the
humbug
now
one
of
the
discoveries
about
my
wife
which
i
but
half
understood
and
made
light
of
had
been
that
she
was
mad
literally
mad
on
the
subject
of
social
climbing
that
means
she
was
possessed
of
the
disease
imported
into
this
country
from
england
where
it
has
raged
for
upward
of
half
a
century
the
disease
of
being
bent
upon
associating
by
hook
or
by
crook
with
people
whose
strongest
desire
seems
to
be
not
to
associate
with
you
this
plague
does
not
spare
the
male
population
by
no
means
but
it
rages
in
and
ravages
the
female
population
almost
to
a
woman
our
women
take
incidental
interest
or
no
interest
in
their
homes
in
their
husbands
in
their
children
their
hearts
are
centered
upon
social
position
and
of
course
the
money
squandering
necessary
to
attaining
or
to
keeping
it
the
women
who
are
in
spend
all
their
time
whatever
they
may
seem
to
be
about
in
spitting
upon
and
kicking
the
faces
of
the
women
who
are
trying
to
get
in
the
women
who
are
trying
to
get
in
spend
their
whole
time
in
smiling
and
cringing
and
imploring
and
plotting
and
when
it
seems
expedient
threatening
and
compelling
probe
to
the
bottom
if
you
have
acuteness
enough
which
you
probably
haven
t
probe
to
the
bottom
any
of
the
present
day
activities
of
the
american
woman
i
care
not
what
it
may
be
and
you
will
discover
the
bacillus
of
social
position
biting
merrily
away
at
her
if
she
goes
to
church
or
to
a
lecture
or
a
concert
if
she
goes
calling
or
stays
at
home
if
she
joins
a
suffrage
movement
or
a
tenement
reform
propaganda
or
refuses
to
join
if
she
dresses
noisily
or
plainly
if
she
shuns
society
or
seeks
it
if
she
keeps
house
or
leaves
housekeeping
to
servants
roaches
and
mice
if
she
cares
for
or
neglects
her
children
if
she
pets
her
husband
or
displaces
him
with
another
no
matter
what
she
does
it
is
at
the
behest
of
the
poison
flowing
through
brain
and
vein
from
the
social
position
bacillus
she
thinks
by
doing
whatever
she
does
she
will
somehow
make
her
position
more
brilliant
or
less
insecure
or
having
no
position
at
all
will
gain
one
and
the
men
they
pay
the
bills
sometimes
reluctantly
again
eagerly
sometimes
ignorantly
again
with
full
knowledge
the
men
they
pay
the
bills
now
you
know
better
far
than
i
knew
at
the
time
why
our
happy
little
family
went
to
brooklyn
took
the
house
in
bedford
avenue
which
we
could
ill
afford
if
we
were
to
save
any
money
and
joined
st
mary
s
a
couple
of
years
after
we
were
married
my
wife
stopped
me
when
i
was
telling
her
what
had
happened
at
the
office
that
day
as
was
my
habit
you
ought
to
leave
all
those
things
outside
when
you
come
home
said
she
she
had
read
this
in
a
book
somewhere
i
guess
it
was
a
new
idea
to
me
why
should
i
said
i
home
is
a
place
for
happiness
with
all
the
sordidness
shut
out
explained
she
those
sordid
things
ought
not
to
touch
our
life
together
this
sounded
all
right
it
seemed
to
me
stammered
i
apologetically
that
my
career
the
way
i
was
getting
on
that
our
bread
and
butter
well
i
thought
we
ought
to
kind
of
talk
it
over
together
oh
i
do
sympathize
with
you
said
or
rather
quoted
she
but
my
place
is
to
soothe
and
smooth
away
the
cares
of
business
you
ought
to
try
not
to
think
of
them
at
home
but
what
would
i
think
about
cried
i
much
perplexed
why
my
business
is
all
i
ve
got
it
s
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
to
us
it
means
our
living
at
least
that
s
the
way
the
thing
looks
to
me
you
ought
to
think
at
home
about
the
higher
side
of
life
the
intellectual
side
but
my
business
is
my
intellectual
side
i
said
and
i
can
t
for
the
life
of
me
see
why
thinking
about
things
that
don
t
advance
us
and
don
t
pay
the
bills
is
better
than
thinking
about
things
that
do
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
looking
on
my
business
as
something
to
be
left
on
the
mud
scraper
at
the
entrance
indicated
a
false
idea
of
it
got
somewhere
so
i
added
somewhat
warmly
there
s
nothing
low
or
bad
about
my
business
and
that
was
the
truth
at
the
time
i
don
t
know
anything
about
it
replied
she
with
the
gentle
patience
of
her
superior
refinement
and
education
and
i
don
t
want
to
know
those
things
don
t
interest
me
and
i
think
godfrey
very
sweetly
with
her
cheek
against
mine
the
reason
husbands
and
wives
often
grow
apart
is
that
the
husband
gives
his
whole
mind
to
his
business
and
doesn
t
develop
the
higher
side
of
his
nature
the
side
that
appeals
to
a
woman
and
satisfies
her
this
touched
my
sense
of
humor
mildly
my
father
gives
his
mind
to
one
of
those
high
sides
said
i
and
we
nearly
starved
to
death
your
father
exclaimed
she
in
derisive
disgust
my
father
said
i
cheerfully
he
does
nothing
but
read
talk
and
think
politics
politics
that
isn
t
on
the
higher
side
women
don
t
care
anything
about
that
well
what
do
they
care
about
i
inquired
about
music
and
literature
and
those
artistic
things
oh
those
things
are
all
right
said
i
but
i
don
t
see
that
it
takes
any
more
brains
or
any
better
brains
to
paint
a
picture
or
sing
a
song
or
write
a
novel
than
it
does
to
run
a
railroad
or
to
plan
one
if
you
d
try
to
understand
business
dear
i
urged
you
might
find
it
as
interesting
and
as
intellectual
as
anything
that
doesn
t
help
us
make
a
living
anyhow
i
ve
simply
got
to
give
my
brains
to
my
work
you
go
ahead
and
attend
to
the
higher
side
for
the
family
i
ll
stick
to
the
job
that
butters
the
bread
and
keeps
the
rain
off
she
was
patient
with
me
but
i
saw
she
didn
t
approve
however
as
i
knew
she
d
approve
still
less
if
i
failed
to
provide
for
her
and
the
two
young
ones
there
were
two
at
that
time
i
let
the
matter
drop
and
held
to
the
common
sense
course
i
hadn
t
the
faintest
notion
of
the
seriousness
of
that
little
talk
of
ours
and
it
was
well
i
hadn
t
for
to
have
made
her
realize
her
folly
i
d
have
had
to
start
in
and
educate
her
uneducate
her
and
then
re
ducate
her
i
don
t
blame
the
women
i
feel
sorry
for
them
when
i
hear
them
talk
about
the
lack
of
sympathy
between
themselves
and
american
men
about
the
low
ideals
and
the
sordid
talk
the
men
indulge
in
how
dull
it
is
how
different
from
the
inspiring
cultured
talk
a
woman
hears
among
the
aristocrats
abroad
said
aristocrats
being
supported
in
helpless
idleness
throughout
their
useless
lives
often
by
hard
earned
american
dollars
when
i
hear
this
pitiful
balderdash
from
fair
lips
i
grow
sad
the
american
woman
fancies
she
is
growing
away
from
the
american
man
the
truth
is
that
while
she
is
sitting
still
playing
with
a
lapful
of
the
artificial
flowers
of
fake
culture
like
a
poor
doodle
wit
the
american
man
is
growing
away
from
her
she
knows
nothing
of
value
she
can
do
nothing
of
value
she
has
nothing
to
offer
the
american
man
but
her
physical
charms
for
he
has
no
time
or
taste
for
playing
with
artificial
flowers
when
the
world
s
important
work
is
to
be
done
so
the
poor
creature
grows
more
isolated
more
neglected
less
respected
and
less
sought
except
in
a
physical
way
and
all
the
while
she
hugs
to
her
bosom
the
delusion
that
she
is
the
great
soul
high
sorrowful
the
world
moves
many
are
the
penalties
for
the
nation
or
the
race
or
the
sex
that
does
not
move
with
it
or
does
not
move
quickly
enough
i
feel
sorry
for
the
american
woman
unless
she
has
a
father
who
will
leave
her
rich
or
a
husband
who
will
give
her
riches
i
feel
some
of
my
readers
saying
that
i
must
have
been
most
unfortunate
in
the
women
i
have
known
perhaps
but
may
it
not
be
that
those
commiserating
readers
have
been
rarely
fortunate
in
their
feminine
acquaintances
or
in
lack
of
insight
now
you
probably
not
only
know
why
we
went
to
brooklyn
but
also
what
we
did
after
we
got
there
i
have
not
forgotten
my
promise
to
gentle
reader
i
shall
not
linger
many
moments
in
brooklyn
true
it
is
superior
to
passaic
at
least
to
the
part
of
passaic
in
which
i
constrained
gentle
reader
to
tarry
a
minute
or
two
but
it
is
still
far
from
the
promised
heights
my
wife
owes
a
vast
deal
to
brooklyn
as
she
haughtily
ignores
the
debt
would
deny
it
if
publicly
charged
i
shall
pay
it
for
her
brooklyn
was
her
finishing
school
it
made
her
what
she
is
in
the
last
year
or
so
we
spent
in
passaic
there
had
been
as
i
have
hinted
a
marked
outward
change
in
all
three
of
us
the
least
or
rather
the
least
abrupt
change
had
been
in
me
associated
in
business
with
a
more
prosperous
and
better
dressed
and
better
educated
class
of
men
i
had
gradually
picked
up
the
sort
of
knowledge
a
man
needs
to
fit
himself
for
the
inevitably
changing
social
conditions
accompanying
a
steady
advance
in
material
prosperity
i
was
as
quick
to
learn
one
kind
of
useful
thing
as
another
and
just
as
i
learned
how
to
fill
larger
and
larger
positions
and
how
to
make
money
out
of
the
chances
that
come
to
a
man
situated
where
money
is
to
be
made
so
i
learned
how
to
dress
like
a
man
of
the
better
class
how
to
speak
a
less
slangy
and
a
less
ungrammatical
english
how
to
use
my
mind
in
thinking
and
in
discussing
a
thousand
subjects
not
directly
related
to
my
business
if
my
wife
had
been
interested
in
any
of
the
important
things
of
the
world
i
could
have
been
of
the
greatest
assistance
to
her
and
she
to
me
and
we
should
have
grown
ever
closer
together
in
sympathetic
companionship
but
although
she
had
a
good
mind
a
superior
mind
she
cared
about
nothing
but
the
things
that
interest
foolish
women
and
still
more
foolish
men
for
a
man
who
cares
about
splurge
and
show
and
social
position
and
such
nonsense
is
less
excusable
is
more
foolish
than
a
woman
of
the
same
sort
women
have
the
excuse
of
lack
of
serious
occupation
but
what
excuse
has
a
man
still
she
was
not
idle
not
for
a
minute
she
was
on
the
contrary
in
her
way
as
busy
as
i
from
time
to
time
she
would
say
to
me
enigmatically
you
don
t
appreciate
it
but
i
am
preparing
myself
to
help
you
fill
the
station
your
business
ability
will
win
us
a
chance
at
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
doing
that
alone
for
what
was
necessary
to
fill
that
station
but
higher
and
higher
skill
as
a
man
of
affairs
when
we
had
made
our
entry
in
brooklyn
and
had
seated
ourselves
in
the
state
in
bedford
avenue
which
she
had
decided
for
she
showed
that
she
felt
immensely
proud
of
herself
we
took
the
house
furnished
throughout
nicely
furnished
in
a
substantial
way
for
it
had
been
the
home
of
one
of
the
old
brooklyn
mercantile
families
it
s
good
enough
to
start
with
said
she
casting
a
critical
glance
round
the
sober
homelike
dining
room
i
shan
t
make
any
changes
till
i
look
about
me
we
couldn
t
be
better
off
said
i
everything
is
perfectly
comfortable
and
in
fact
neither
she
nor
i
had
ever
before
known
what
comfort
was
looking
at
that
house
merely
looking
at
it
and
puzzling
out
the
uses
of
the
various
things
to
us
theretofore
unknown
was
about
as
important
in
the
way
of
education
as
learning
to
read
is
to
a
child
it
s
good
enough
for
brooklyn
said
she
she
regarded
me
with
her
patient
tender
expression
of
the
superior
intelligence
you
haven
t
much
imagination
or
ambition
godfrey
she
went
on
but
fortunately
i
have
and
do
be
careful
not
to
betray
us
before
the
servants
i
m
engaging
the
show
part
of
the
house
continued
to
look
about
as
it
had
when
we
took
possession
but
the
living
part
went
to
pieces
rapidly
we
had
many
servants
we
spent
much
money
so
much
that
if
i
had
not
been
speculating
in
various
ways
we
should
have
soon
gone
under
but
the
results
were
miserably
poor
my
wife
left
everything
to
her
servants
and
devoted
herself
to
her
social
career
the
ex
brooklyn
society
woman
at
passaic
had
not
deceived
her
no
sooner
had
she
joined
st
mary
s
than
she
began
to
have
friends
friends
of
a
far
higher
social
rank
than
she
had
ever
even
seen
at
close
range
before
they
were
elegant
people
indeed
the
wives
of
the
heads
of
departments
in
big
stores
the
families
of
bank
officers
and
lawyers
and
doctors
there
were
even
a
few
rather
rich
people
my
wife
was
in
ecstasy
for
a
year
or
two
and
she
improved
rapidly
in
looks
in
dress
in
manners
in
speech
in
all
ways
except
in
disposition
and
character
except
in
disposition
and
character
as
we
grow
older
and
rise
in
the
world
there
is
always
a
deterioration
both
in
disposition
and
in
character
a
man
s
disposition
grows
sharper
through
dealing
with
and
having
to
deal
sharply
with
incompetence
the
character
tends
to
harden
as
he
is
forced
to
make
the
unpleasant
and
often
not
too
scrupulous
moves
necessary
to
getting
himself
forward
toward
success
also
the
way
everyone
tries
to
use
a
successful
man
makes
him
more
and
more
acute
in
penetrating
to
the
real
motives
of
his
fellow
beings
more
and
more
inclined
to
take
up
men
for
what
he
can
get
out
of
them
and
drop
them
when
he
has
squeezed
out
all
the
advantage
in
brief
to
treat
them
precisely
as
they
treat
him
but
the
whole
object
in
having
a
home
a
wife
a
family
is
defeated
if
the
man
has
not
there
a
something
that
checks
the
tendencies
to
cynicism
and
coldness
which
active
life
not
merely
encourages
but
even
compels
there
was
no
occasion
for
edna
s
becoming
vixenish
and
hard
it
was
altogether
due
to
the
idiotic
and
worthless
social
climbing
she
had
a
swarm
of
friends
yet
not
a
single
friend
she
cultivated
people
socially
and
they
cultivated
her
not
for
the
natural
and
kindly
and
elevating
reasons
but
altogether
for
the
detestable
purposes
of
that
ghastly
craze
for
social
position
edna
was
bitter
against
me
for
a
long
time
never
again
became
fully
reconciled
because
i
soon
flatly
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
they
will
think
there
s
something
wrong
about
you
and
about
me
if
you
don
t
come
with
me
pleaded
she
i
need
my
strength
for
my
business
said
i
and
what
do
i
care
whether
they
think
well
or
ill
of
me
they
don
t
give
us
any
money
you
are
so
sordid
cried
she
sometimes
i
m
almost
tempted
to
give
up
and
not
try
to
be
somebody
and
to
make
somebodies
of
margot
and
you
i
wish
you
would
said
i
why
shouldn
t
we
live
quietly
and
mind
our
own
business
and
be
happy
how
fortunate
it
is
for
margot
that
she
has
a
mother
with
ambition
and
pride
well
no
matter
but
please
do
get
another
cook
this
one
is
if
anything
worse
than
the
last
except
when
we
have
company
we
were
forever
changing
cooks
the
food
that
came
on
our
table
was
something
atrocious
i
heard
the
same
complaint
from
all
my
married
associates
at
the
office
even
from
the
higher
officials
who
were
rich
men
and
lived
in
great
state
they
too
had
american
wives
in
the
markets
and
shops
i
saw
as
i
passed
along
all
sorts
of
attractive
things
to
eat
and
of
real
quality
i
wondered
why
we
never
had
those
things
on
our
table
heaven
knows
we
spent
money
enough
the
time
came
when
i
got
a
clew
to
the
mystery
one
day
edna
said
i
ve
been
doing
my
housekeeping
altogether
by
telephone
i
think
i
ll
stop
it
except
on
rainy
days
and
when
i
don
t
feel
well
by
telephone
i
laughed
to
myself
no
wonder
we
had
poor
stuff
and
paid
the
highest
prices
for
it
i
thought
a
while
then
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
began
to
ask
questions
very
cautiously
for
edna
was
extremely
touchy
as
we
all
are
in
matters
where
in
our
hearts
we
know
we
are
in
the
wrong
do
you
remember
what
kind
of
range
we
have
in
our
kitchen
i
asked
i
exclaimed
she
disgustedly
certainly
not
i
haven
t
been
down
to
the
kitchen
since
we
first
moved
into
this
house
i
ve
something
better
to
do
than
to
meddle
with
the
servants
naturally
said
i
soothingly
and
i
didn
t
let
her
see
how
her
confession
amused
me
what
if
a
man
tried
to
run
his
business
in
that
fashion
and
ordering
by
telephone
why
it
was
an
invitation
to
the
tradespeople
to
swindle
us
in
every
way
but
i
said
nothing
as
usually
either
it
was
bad
weather
or
edna
was
not
feeling
well
or
was
in
a
rush
to
keep
some
social
engagement
the
ordering
for
the
house
continued
to
be
done
by
telephone
when
it
was
not
left
entirely
to
the
discretion
of
the
servants
one
morning
it
so
happened
that
she
and
i
left
the
house
at
the
same
time
said
she
i
m
on
my
way
to
do
the
marketing
it
s
a
terrible
nuisance
and
i
know
so
little
about
those
things
but
it
s
coming
to
be
regarded
as
fashionable
for
a
woman
to
do
her
own
marketing
some
of
the
best
families
people
with
their
own
carriages
and
servants
in
livery
some
of
the
swellest
ladies
in
brooklyn
do
it
now
it
s
a
fad
from
across
the
river
you
must
be
careful
not
to
overtax
yourself
said
i
and
i
said
it
quite
seriously
for
in
those
days
of
my
innocence
i
was
worried
about
her
thought
her
a
poor
overworked
angel
was
glad
i
had
the
money
to
relieve
her
from
the
worst
tasks
and
to
leave
her
free
to
amuse
herself
and
to
take
care
of
her
health
i
had
not
yet
started
in
the
direction
of
ridding
myself
of
the
masculine
delusion
that
woman
is
a
delicate
creature
by
nature
if
she
happens
to
be
a
lady
and
of
course
i
knew
my
edna
was
a
lady
through
and
through
it
was
many
a
year
before
i
learned
the
truth
why
ladies
are
always
ailing
and
why
they
can
do
nothing
but
wear
fine
clothes
and
sit
in
parlors
or
in
carriages
when
they
are
not
sitting
at
indigestible
food
and
amuse
themselves
and
pity
themselves
for
being
condemned
to
live
with
coarse
uninteresting
american
men
yes
i
was
sincere
in
urging
her
to
take
care
how
she
adopted
so
laborious
a
fad
as
doing
her
own
marketing
she
went
on
if
i
had
a
carriage
it
wouldn
t
be
so
bad
she
said
this
sweetly
enough
and
with
no
suggestion
of
reproach
just
the
sigh
of
a
lady
s
soul
at
the
hardness
of
life
s
conditions
but
i
loving
her
felt
as
if
i
were
somehow
to
blame
you
shall
have
a
carriage
before
many
years
said
i
that
s
one
of
the
things
i
ve
been
working
for
she
gave
me
a
look
that
made
me
feel
proud
i
had
her
to
live
for
i
hope
i
ll
be
here
to
enjoy
it
sighed
she
i
walked
sad
and
silent
by
her
side
profoundly
impressed
and
depressed
by
that
hint
as
to
her
feeble
health
i
know
now
it
was
sheer
pretense
with
her
the
more
easily
to
manage
me
and
to
cover
her
shortcomings
i
ought
to
have
realized
it
then
but
what
man
does
she
certainly
did
not
look
ill
for
she
was
not
one
of
those
who
were
always
stuffing
themselves
at
teas
and
lunches
and
talked
of
a
walk
of
five
blocks
as
hard
exercise
she
had
learned
how
to
keep
health
and
beauty
what
intelligence
it
shows
that
she
was
able
to
grasp
so
difficult
a
matter
and
what
splendid
persistence
that
she
was
able
to
carry
out
a
mode
of
life
so
disagreeable
to
self
indulgence
if
her
intelligence
and
her
persistence
could
have
been
turned
to
use
presently
we
were
at
the
butcher
shop
i
paused
in
the
doorway
while
she
engaged
in
her
arduous
labor
here
is
the
conversation
good
morning
mr
toomey
very
gracious
the
lady
speaking
to
the
trades
person
good
morning

cracked
and
broken
nailed

lamb

very
tough
sorry
ma

but
those
kind
of
things
will
happen
you

most
flatteringly
humble
of
manner
yes
i
know
do
your
best
i
m
sure

try
to
please

me
see

chickens
for
broiling

ll
pick
out
nice
ones
yes
indeed
ma
am
i
ll
attend
to
it

and
something
for
the
servants
you

what
they
like
yes
ma

i
ll
attend
to
it
and
you

will

years

dare
send
anything
else
to
you
ma
am
groveling
a
gracious
smile
a
gracious
nod
and
edna
rejoined
me
innocent
as
i
was
and
under
the
spell
that
blinds
the
american
man
where
the
american
woman
is
concerned
i
could
not
but
be
upset
by
this
example
of
how
our
house
was
run
an
example
that
all
in
an
instant
brought
to
my
mind
and
enabled
me
to
understand
a
score
a
hundred
similar
examples
there
was
i
toiling
away
to
make
money
earning
every
dollar
by
the
hardest
kind
of
mental
labor
struggling
to
rise
to
make
our
fortune
and
each
day
my
wife
was
tossing
carelessly
out
of
the
windows
into
the
street
a
large
part
of
my
earnings
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
about
it
edna
s
next
stop
was
at
the
grocer
s
i
had
not
the
courage
to
halt
and
listen
i
knew
it
would
be
a
repetition
of
the
grotesque
interview
with
the
butcher
and
she
undoubtedly
a
clever
woman
alert
improving
what
a
mystery
i
went
on
to
my
office
that
day
without
giving
my
acquaintances
there
an
inkling
of
what
was
in
my
mind
i
made
inquiries
into
how
their
wives
spent
the
money
that
went
for
food
the
most
important
item
in
the
spending
of
incomes
under
ten
or
twelve
thousand
a
year
in
every
case
the
wife
or
the
mother
did
the
marketing
by
telephone
all
the
men
except
one
took
the
ignorance
and
incompetence
of
the
management
of
the
household
expenses
as
a
matter
of
course
one
man
grumbled
a
little
i
remember
he
said
no
wonder
it
s
hard
for
the
men
to
save
anything
the
women
waste
most
of
it
on
the
table
paying
double
prices
for
poor
stuff
i
tell
you
loring
the
american
woman
is
responsible
for
the
dishonesty
of
american
commercial
life
they
are
always
nagging
at
the
man
for
more
and
more
money
to
spend
and
in
spending
it
they
tempt
the
merchants
the
clerks
their
own
servants
everyone
within
range
to
become
swindlers
and
thieves
oh
nonsense
said
i
you
re
a
pessimist
the
american
woman
is
all
right
where
d
you
find
her
equal
for
intelligence
and
charm
she
may
be
intelligent
said
he
she
doesn
t
use
it
on
anything
worth
while
except
roping
in
some
poor
sucker
to
put
up
for
her
and
to
put
up
with
her
and
she
may
have
charm
but
not
for
a
man
who
has
cut
his
matrimonial
eye
teeth
i
laughed
at
van
dyck
that
was
my
grumbling
friend
s
name
and
i
soon
dropped
the
subject
from
my
mind
it
has
never
been
my
habit
to
waste
time
in
thinking
about
things
when
the
thinking
could
not
possibly
lead
anywhere
you
may
say
i
ought
to
have
interfered
forced
my
wife
to
come
to
her
senses
compelled
her
to
learn
her
business
which
shows
that
you
know
little
about
the
nature
of
the
american
woman
if
i
had
taken
that
course
she
would
have
hated
me
she
would
have
done
no
better
and
she
would
have
scorned
me
as
a
sordid
haggler
over
small
sums
of
money
who
was
trying
to
spoil
with
the
vulgarities
of
commercial
life
the
beauties
of
the
home
no
i
instinctively
knew
enough
not
to
interfere
but
let
us
take
a
long
leap
forward
to
the
day
when
i
became
president
of
the
railroad
having
made
myself
a
rich
man
by
judicious
gambling
with
eight
thousand
dollars
loaned
me
by
father
wheatlands
he
was
a
rich
man
and
in
the
way
to
become
very
rich
and
he
had
no
heir
but
edna
after
the
drowning
of
her
two
brothers
under
a
sailboat
in
newark
bay
margot
was
in
a
fashionable
school
over
in
new
york
my
wife
and
i
still
a
young
couple
and
she
beautiful
my
wife
and
i
were
as
happy
as
any
married
couple
can
be
where
they
let
each
other
alone
and
the
husband
gives
the
wife
all
the
money
she
wishes
and
leaves
her
free
to
spend
it
as
she
pleases
when
i
told
her
of
my
good
fortune
and
the
sudden
and
large
betterment
of
our
finances
she
said
with
a
curious
lighting
of
the
eyes
a
curious
strengthening
of
the
chin
now
for
new
york
new
york
said
i
what
does
that
mean
we
are
going
to
live
in
new
york
replied
she
but
we
do
live
in
new
york
brooklyn
is
part
of
new
york
legally
i
suppose
it
is
replied
she
but
morally
and
sthetically
socially
and
in
every
other
civilized
way
my
dear
godfrey
it
is
part
of
the
backwoods
i
can
hardly
wait
to
get
away
why
i
thought
you
were
happy
here
exclaimed
i
marveling
used
though
i
was
to
her
keeping
her
own
counsel
strictly
about
the
matters
that
most
interested
her
you
ve
certainly
acted
as
if
you
loved
it
i
didn
t
mind
it
at
first
conceded
she
but
for
two
or
three
years
i
have
loathed
it
and
everybody
that
lives
in
it
i
was
amazed
at
this
last
sally
oh
come
now
edna
cried
i
you
ve
got
lots
of
friends
here
lots
and
lots
of
them
i
was
thinking
of
the
dozen
or
so
women
whom
she
called
and
who
called
her
by
the
first
name
women
she
was
with
early
and
late
women
she
was
daily
playing
bridge
with
bridge
i
have
a
friend
who
declares
that
bridge
is
ruining
the
american
home
and
i
see
his
point
but
i
think
he
doesn
t
look
deep
enough
if
it
weren
t
bridge
it
would
be
something
else
bridge
is
a
striking
example
but
only
a
single
example
of
the
results
of
feminine
folly
and
idleness
that
all
flow
from
the
same
cause
however
let
us
go
back
to
my
talk
with
edna
she
met
my
protest
in
behalf
of
her
friends
with
a
contemptuous
i
don
t
know
a
soul
who
isn
t
frightfully
common
they
re
the
same
sort
of
people
we
are
not
the
same
sort
that
i
am
declared
she
proudly
and
not
the
sort
margot
and
you
are
going
to
be
you
ll
see
you
don
t
know
about
these
things
but
fortunately
i
do
you
don
t
seriously
mean
that
you
want
to
leave
this
splendid
old
house
splendid
it
s
hardly
fit
to
live
in
of
course
we
had
to
endure
it
while
we
were
poor
and
obscure
but
now
it
won
t
do
at
all
and
go
away
from
all
these
people
you
ve
worked
so
hard
to
get
in
with
all
these
friends
go
away
among
strangers
i
don
t
mind
but
what
would
you
do
how
d
you
pass
the
days
these
vulgar
people
bore
me
to
death
declared
she
i
ve
been
advancing
if
you
have
stood
still
thank
god
i
ve
got
ambition
heaven
knows
they
ve
never
been
my
friends
said
i
but
i
must
say
they
seem
nice
enough
people
as
people
go
what
s
the
matter
with
em
they
re
common
said
she
with
the
languor
of
one
explaining
when
he
feels
he
will
not
be
understood
they
re
tiresome
i
ll
admit
they
re
tiresome
said
i
that
s
why
i
ve
kept
away
from
them
but
i
doubt
if
they
re
more
tiresome
than
people
generally
the
fact
is
my
dear
people
are
all
tiresome
that
s
why
they
can
t
amuse
themselves
or
each
other
but
have
to
be
amused
have
to
hire
the
clever
people
of
all
sorts
to
entertain
them
instead
of
asking
people
here
to
bore
us
and
to
be
bored
why
not
send
them
seats
at
a
theater
or
orders
for
a
first
class
meal
at
a
first
class
restaurant
i
suppose
you
think
that
s
funny
said
my
wife
she
had
no
sense
of
humor
and
the
suggestion
of
a
jest
irritated
her
yes
it
does
strike
me
as
funny
i
admitted
but
there
s
sense
in
it
too
i
m
sure
you
don
t
want
to
abandon
your
friends
here
why
make
ourselves
uncomfortable
all
over
again
i
took
a
serious
persuasive
tone
edna
we
re
beginning
to
get
used
to
the
more
stylish
way
of
living
we
took
up
when
we
left
passaic
and
came
here
to
live
is
it
sensible
to
branch
out
again
into
the
untried
and
the
unknown
will
we
be
any
wiser
or
any
happier
you
can
shine
as
the
big
star
now
in
this
circle
of
friends
you
like
to
run
things
socially
here
s
your
chance
how
could
i
get
any
pleasure
out
of
running
things
socially
in
st
mary
s
demanded
she
i
ve
outgrown
it
it
seems
vulgar
and
common
to
me
it
is
vulgar
and
common
what
does
that
mean
i
asked
innocently
if
you
don
t
understand
i
can
t
tell
you
replied
she
tartly
surely
you
must
see
that
your
wife
and
your
daughter
are
superior
to
these
people
round
here
i
don
t
compare
my
wife
and
daughter
with
other
people
said
i
to
me
they
re
superior
to
anybody
and
everybody
else
in
the
world
i
often
wish
we
lived
way
off
in
the
country
somewhere
i
m
sure
we
d
be
happier
with
only
each
other
we
re
putting
on
too
much
style
to
suit
me
even
now
i
see
you
living
in
the
country
laughed
she
you
d
come
down
about
once
a
week
or
month
i
couldn
t
deny
the
truth
in
her
accusation
i
felt
it
ought
to
have
been
that
my
wife
and
i
were
so
sympathetic
so
interested
in
the
same
things
that
we
were
absorbed
in
each
other
but
the
facts
were
against
it
we
really
had
almost
nothing
in
common
i
admired
her
beauty
and
also
her
intelligence
and
energy
though
i
thought
them
misdirected
she
i
think
liked
me
in
the
primitive
way
of
a
woman
with
a
man
and
she
admired
my
ability
to
make
money
though
she
thought
it
rather
a
low
form
of
intellectual
excellence
however
as
she
found
it
extremely
useful
she
admired
me
for
it
in
a
way
i
have
seen
much
of
the
aristocratic
temperament
that
despises
money
but
i
have
yet
to
see
an
aristocrat
who
wasn
t
greedier
than
the
greediest
money
grubber
and
i
must
say
it
is
hard
to
conceive
anything
lower
than
the
spirit
that
grabs
the
gift
and
despises
the
giver
but
then
some
day
when
thinking
is
done
more
clearly
we
shall
all
see
that
aristocracy
and
its
spirit
is
the
lowest
level
of
human
nature
is
simply
a
deep
seated
survival
of
barbarism
however
edna
and
i
appealed
to
and
satisfied
each
other
in
one
way
beyond
that
our
congeniality
abruptly
ended
looking
back
i
see
now
that
talking
with
her
was
never
a
pleasure
nor
was
it
a
pleasure
to
her
to
talk
with
me
i
irritated
her
she
bored
me
how
rarely
in
our
country
do
you
find
a
woman
who
is
an
interesting
companion
for
a
man
except
as
female
and
male
pair
or
survey
the
prospect
of
pairing
and
it
matters
not
what
line
of
activity
the
man
is
taking
business
politics
literature
art
philanthropy
even
the
women
are
eternally
talking
about
their
superiority
to
the
business
man
but
do
they
get
along
any
better
with
an
artist
unless
he
is
cultivating
the
woman
for
the
sake
of
an
order
for
a
picture
is
there
any
line
of
serious
endeavor
in
which
an
american
woman
is
interesting
and
helpful
and
companionable
to
a
man
i
can
get
along
very
well
with
an
artist
i
have
one
friend
who
is
a
writer
of
novels
another
who
is
a
writer
of
plays
a
third
who
is
a
sculptor
they
are
interested
in
my
work
and
i
in
theirs
we
talk
together
on
a
basis
of
equal
interest
and
we
give
each
other
ideas
can
any
american
woman
say
the
same
i
don
t
inquire
anticipating
a
negative
answer
i
simply
put
the
question
but
i
suspect
the
answer
would
put
a
pin
in
the
bubble
of
the
american
woman
s
pretense
of
superior
culture
she
is
fooled
by
her
vanity
i
fear
and
by
her
sex
attraction
and
by
the
influence
of
the
money
her
despised
father
or
husband
gives
her
there
s
a
reason
why
america
is
notoriously
the
land
of
bachelor
husbands
and
that
reason
is
not
the
one
the
women
and
foreign
fortune
hunters
assert
the
american
man
lets
the
case
go
by
default
against
him
not
because
he
couldn
t
answer
nor
yet
because
he
is
polite
but
because
he
is
indifferent
but
my
wife
was
talking
about
her
projected
assault
upon
new
york
i
really
must
be
an
extraordinary
woman
said
she
how
i
have
fought
all
these
years
to
raise
myself
with
you
dragging
at
me
to
keep
me
down
i
protested
her
unhappy
husband
why
dear
i
ve
never
opposed
you
in
any
way
and
i
ve
tried
to
do
what
i
could
to
help
you
you
must
admit
the
money
s
been
useful
oh
you
ve
never
been
mean
about
money
conceded
she
but
you
don
t
sympathize
with
a
single
one
of
my
ideals
i
want
you
to
have
whatever
you
want
said
i
and
anything
i
can
do
to
get
it
for
you
or
to
help
you
get
it
i
stand
ready
to
do
yes
i
know
godfrey
dear
said
she
giving
me
a
long
hug
and
a
kiss
no
woman
ever
had
a
more
generous
husband
than
i
have
i
naturally
attached
more
importance
to
this
burst
of
enthusiasm
then
than
i
do
now
and
it
is
as
well
that
i
was
thus
simple
minded
how
little
pleasure
we
would
get
to
be
sure
if
when
we
are
praised
or
loved
by
anybody
because
we
do
that
person
a
kindness
we
paused
to
analyze
and
saw
the
shallow
selfishness
of
such
praise
or
such
love
after
all
it
s
only
human
nature
to
like
those
who
do
as
we
ask
them
and
to
dislike
those
who
don
t
and
i
am
not
quarreling
with
human
nature
or
with
any
other
of
the
unchangeable
conditions
of
the
universe
my
own
love
for
edna
what
was
it
but
the
natural
result
of
my
getting
what
i
wanted
from
her
all
i
wanted
i
really
troubled
myself
little
about
her
incompetence
and
extravagance
and
craze
for
social
position
no
doubt
to
this
day
i
should
be
but
i
am
again
anticipating
generous
nonsense
said
i
it
isn
t
generous
to
try
to
make
you
happy
that
s
my
one
chance
of
being
happy
myself
a
busy
man
s
got
to
have
peace
at
home
if
he
hasn
t
he
s
like
a
soldier
attacked
rear
and
front
at
the
same
time
i
know
you
don
t
care
where
we
live
she
went
on
and
for
margot
s
sake
we
ve
simply
got
to
move
to
new
york
oh
you
want
her
to
stay
at
home
of
nights
instead
of
living
at
the
school
why
didn
t
you
speak
of
that
first
not
at
all
cried
she
how
slow
you
are
no
for
the
present
even
if
we
do
live
in
new
york
i
think
it
best
for
margot
to
keep
on
living
at
the
school
she
s
barely
started
there
i
want
her
training
to
be
thorough
and
while
i
m
learning
as
fast
as
i
can
i
am
not
competent
to
teach
her
i
know
of
course
but
i
haven
t
had
the
chance
to
practice
so
i
can
t
teach
her
teach
her
what
i
inquired
to
be
a
lady
a
practical
expert
lady
replied
edna
that
s
what
she
s
going
to
miss
ryper
s
school
for
and
when
she
comes
out
she
ll
be
the
equal
of
girls
who
have
generations
of
culture
and
breeding
behind
them
god
bless
me
cried
i
laughing
this
ryper
woman
must
be
a
wonder
she
is
declared
edna
it
was
a
great
favor
her
letting
margot
into
the
school
oh
i
remember
said
i
she
couldn
t
do
it
until
i
got
two
of
the
directors
of
the
road
to
insist
on
it
but
i
guess
that
was
merely
a
bluff
of
hers
to
squeeze
us
for
a
few
hundreds
extra
not
at
all
edna
assured
me
you
are
so
ignorant
godfrey
please
do
be
careful
not
to
say
those
coarse
things
before
people
as
you
please
said
i
cheerfully
for
i
was
used
to
this
kind
of
calling
down
all
the
same
the
ryper
lady
is
hot
for
the
dough
edna
shivered
she
detested
slang
continued
to
detest
and
avoid
it
even
after
she
learned
that
it
was
fashionable
miss
ryper
guards
her
list
of
pupils
as
their
mothers
guard
their
visiting
lists
said
she
but
now
she
likes
margot
the
dear
child
has
been
elected
to
the
most
exclusive
fraternity
every
girl
in
it
has
to
wear
hand
made
underclothes
and
has
to
have
had
at
least
a
father
a
grandfather
and
a
great
grandfather
edna
laughed
with
pride
at
her
own
cleverness
before
she
went
on
margot
came
to
me
when
she
was
proposed
and
cried
as
if
her
little
heart
would
break
she
said
she
didn
t
know
anything
about
her
grandfather
and
great
grandfather
but
i
hadn
t
forgotten
to
arrange
that
i
think
of
everything
oh
that
was
easy
enough
said
i
your
grandfather
was
a
tailor
and
mine
was
in
the
grocery
business
like
father
edna
looked
round
in
terror
sh
she
exclaimed
servants
always
listen
she
went
to
the
door
we
were
in
the
small
upstairs
sitting
room
opened
it
suddenly
looked
into
the
hall
closed
the
door
and
returned
to
a
chair
nearer
the
lounge
on
which
i
was
stretched
comfortably
smoking
what
s
the
matter
said
i
no
one
was
there
said
she
haven
t
i
told
you
never
to
speak
of
of
those
horrible
things
but
margot
margot
doesn
t
know
she
must
never
know
poor
child
she
is
so
sensitive
it
would
make
her
ill
i
lapsed
into
gloomy
silence
i
had
not
liked
the
way
edna
had
been
acting
about
her
parents
and
mine
ever
since
we
came
to
brooklyn
but
i
had
been
busy
and
was
averse
to
meddling
i
gave
margot
for
the
benefit
of
the
girls
a
genealogy
i
ve
gotten
up
she
went
on
you
know
all
genealogies
are
more
or
less
faked
and
i
ve
no
doubt
hers
is
every
bit
as
genuine
as
those
of
half
the
girls
over
there
i
fixed
ours
so
that
it
would
take
a
lot
of
inquiry
to
expose
it
and
margot
got
into
the
fraternity
are
the
hand
made
underclothes
fake
too
said
i
oh
no
they
had
to
be
genuine
i
ve
never
let
margot
wear
any
other
kind
since
i
learned
about
those
things
there
s
nothing
that
gives
a
child
such
a
sense
of
ladylikeness
and
superiority
as
to
feel
she
s
dressed
right
from
the
skin
out
well
school
s
a
different
sort
of
a
place
from
what
it
was
in
our
day
said
i
the
picture
my
wife
had
drawn
amused
me
but
i
somehow
did
not
exactly
like
it
my
mind
was
too
little
interested
in
the
direction
of
the
things
that
absorbed
edna
for
me
to
be
able
to
put
into
any
sort
of
shape
the
thoughts
vaguely
moving
about
in
the
shadows
i
ll
bet
i
went
on
poor
margot
doesn
t
have
as
good
a
time
as
we
had
she
d
hate
that
kind
of
a
time
said
edna
i
laughed
and
laid
my
hand
in
her
lap
her
hand
stole
into
it
i
watched
her
lovely
face
the
sweet
dreamy
expression
what
are
you
thinking
said
i
softly
hopeful
of
romance
what
i
call
romance
i
was
thinking
how
low
and
awful
we
used
to
be
replied
she
and
how
splendidly
we
are
getting
away
from
it
i
laughed
for
i
was
used
to
cold
water
on
my
romance
all
the
same
insisted
i
margot
would
envy
us
if
she
knew
she
d
hate
it
edna
repeated
she
s
going
to
be
an
improvement
on
us
not
on
you
i
protested
she
looked
at
me
with
tender
sparkling
eyes
the
same
lovely
light
brown
eyes
that
had
fascinated
me
as
a
boy
brown
eyes
for
a
woman
always
but
they
must
not
be
of
the
heavy
commonplace
shades
of
brown
like
a
deer
s
or
a
cow
s
they
must
have
light
shades
in
them
tints
verging
toward
blue
or
green
said
edna
i
m
doing
my
best
to
fit
myself
and
before
i
get
through
godfrey
i
think
i
ll
go
far
sure
you
will
said
i
with
no
disposition
to
turn
the
cold
douche
on
her
kind
of
romance
what
an
idiot
i
was
about
her
to
be
sure
i
went
on
and
i
ll
see
that
you
have
the
money
to
grease
the
toboggan
slide
and
make
the
going
easy
she
talked
on
happily
and
confidingly
yes
it
s
best
to
leave
margot
another
year
as
a
boarder
at
miss
ryper
s
by
that
time
we
ll
be
established
over
in
new
york
and
we
ll
have
a
proper
place
for
her
to
receive
her
friends
and
perhaps
we
ll
have
a
few
friends
of
our
own
swell
friends
eh
please
don
t
say
swell
dear
corrected
she
it
s
such
a
common
word
i
ve
heard
you
say
it
i
protested
but
i
don
t
any
more
i
ve
learned
better
and
now
i
ve
taught
you
better
anything
you
like
anybody
you
like
said
i
when
edna
and
i
were
together
with
our
hands
clasped
i
was
always
completely
under
her
spell
she
could
do
what
she
pleased
with
me
so
long
of
course
as
she
didn
t
interfere
in
my
end
of
the
firm
and
i
may
add
that
she
never
did
she
hadn
t
the
faintest
notion
what
i
was
about
they
say
there
are
thousands
of
american
women
in
the
cities
who
know
their
husbands
places
of
business
only
as
street
and
telephone
numbers
my
wife
was
one
of
that
kind
oh
yes
from
the
standpoint
of
those
who
insist
that
business
and
home
should
be
separate
we
were
a
model
couple
there
s
another
matter
i
want
to
talk
over
with
you
godfrey
she
went
on
that
s
a
lovely
dress
you
re
wearing
said
i
it
goes
so
well
with
your
skin
and
your
hair
she
was
delighted
and
was
moved
to
rise
and
look
at
herself
in
the
long
mirror
she
gave
herself
an
approving
glance
but
not
more
approving
than
what
she
saw
merited
a
long
slim
beautiful
figure
a
dress
that
set
it
off
a
lovely
young
tip
tilted
face
the
face
of
a
girl
with
fresh
clear
eyes
and
skin
the
whitest
evenest
sharp
teeth
and
such
hair
such
quantities
of
hair
attractively
arranged
from
herself
she
glanced
at
me
no
one
d
ever
think
what
we
came
from
would
they
said
she
fondly
and
proudly
oh
godfrey
it
makes
me
so
happy
that
we
look
the
part
we
belong
where
we
re
going
the
good
blood
away
back
in
the
family
is
coming
out
and
margot
i
ve
always
called
her
the
little
duchess
and
she
looks
it
and
feels
it
dreamily
maybe
she
will
be
some
day
why
she
s
a
baby
cried
i
for
i
didn
t
like
to
see
that
my
baby
was
growing
up
she
s
nearly
fourteen
said
edna
she
was
looking
at
herself
again
would
you
ever
think
i
had
a
daughter
fourteen
years
old
said
she
making
a
laughing
saucy
face
at
me
i
got
up
and
kissed
her
you
don
t
look
as
old
as
you
did
when
i
married
you
said
i
and
it
was
only
a
slight
exaggeration
when
we
sat
again
she
was
snuggled
into
my
lap
with
her
head
against
my
shoulder
she
was
immensely
fond
of
being
petted
they
say
this
is
no
sign
of
a
loving
nature
that
cats
the
least
loving
of
all
pets
are
fondest
of
petting
i
have
no
opinion
on
the
subject
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
talk
about
said
i
money
no
indeed
laughed
she
i
supposed
so
as
that
s
the
only
matter
in
which
i
have
any
influence
in
this
family
come
to
think
of
it
said
she
it
is
money
in
a
way
it
s
about
our
parents
she
gave
a
deep
sigh
godfrey
they
hang
over
me
like
a
nightmare
her
tragic
seriousness
amused
me
oh
cheer
up
said
i
kissing
her
they
certainly
don
t
fit
in
with
our
stylishness
but
they
re
away
off
there
in
passaic
and
bother
us
as
little
as
we
bother
them
the
truth
is
edna
we
ve
not
acted
right
we
ve
been
selfish
spending
all
our
prosperity
on
ourselves
of
course
they
ve
got
everything
they
really
want
but
well
that
s
exactly
it
said
she
eagerly
my
conscience
has
been
hurting
me
we
ought
to
to
it
wouldn
t
cost
much
to
make
them
perfectly
comfortable
so
they
d
not
have
to
work
and
could
get
away
from
the
grocery
and
the
and
the
she
hesitated
before
saying
father
s
business
as
if
nerving
herself
to
pronounce
words
of
shame
and
when
she
did
finally
force
out
the
evading
father
s
business
it
was
with
such
an
accent
that
i
couldn
t
help
laughing
outright
undertaking
s
a
good
paying
business
said
i
we
certainly
ought
to
be
grateful
to
it
it
supplied
the
eight
thousand
dollars
that
gave
me
the
chance
to
buy
half
the
rolling
mill
and
you
know
the
rolling
mill
was
the
start
of
our
fortune
do
you
think
father
could
be
induced
to
retire
she
asked
never
said
i
your
father
s
a
rich
man
for
passaic
he
s
got
two
hundred
thousand
at
least
hived
away
in
tenements
that
pay
from
twenty
to
thirty
five
per
cent
and
his
business
now
brings
in
ten
to
fifteen
thousand
a
year
straight
along
you
can
make
your
father
retire
i
laughed
poor
dad
i
ve
been
keeping
him
from
being
retired
by
the
sheriff
he
s
squeezing
out
a
bare
living
he
d
be
delighted
to
stop
and
have
all
his
time
for
talking
politics
and
religion
you
could
buy
them
a
nice
place
a
little
way
out
in
the
country
on
some
quiet
road
i
m
sure
your
mother
and
your
old
maid
sister
would
love
it
perhaps
said
i
if
it
wasn
t
too
quiet
but
it
must
be
quiet
and
we
ll
induce
my
father
and
mother
to
buy
a
place
near
by
your
father
ll
not
give
up
the
business
i
ve
thought
it
all
out
said
edna
whose
mind
was
equal
to
whatever
task
she
gave
it
you
must
get
some
one
to
offer
him
a
price
he
simply
can
t
refuse
and
make
a
condition
that
he
shall
not
go
into
business
again
aren
t
those
things
done
i
was
somewhat
surprised
but
not
much
at
the
knowledge
of
business
this
displayed
why
why
laughed
i
and
you
pretend
to
know
nothing
about
business
she
was
in
a
sensible
loving
mood
that
day
so
she
said
with
a
quiet
little
laugh
i
make
it
a
point
to
know
anything
that
s
useful
to
me
i
don
t
know
much
about
business
why
should
i
bother
with
it
i
ve
got
confidence
in
you
it
was
not
the
first
time
i
had
got
a
peep
into
her
mind
and
had
seen
how
she
looked
on
everyone
including
me
as
a
wheel
in
her
machine
and
never
interfered
unless
the
wheel
didn
t
work
to
suit
her
i
laughed
delightedly
there
was
something
charmingly
feminine
thought
i
about
this
point
of
view
so
upside
down
yes
i
guess
your
father
ll
jump
for
the
bait
you
suggest
said
i
but
why
disturb
him
he
loves
his
undertaking
she
shivered
and
he
ll
be
miserable
idling
about
oh
i
guess
he
ll
get
along
all
right
said
she
with
sarcasm
and
with
truth
he
ll
devote
himself
to
suing
his
tenants
and
counting
his
money
godfrey
you
simply
must
get
those
people
in
passaic
out
of
our
way
i
ve
been
a
little
nervous
over
here
though
i
knew
that
none
of
these
dreadful
people
we
associate
with
has
anything
better
in
the
way
of
family
than
us
and
some
have
a
lot
worse
oh
it
s
frightful
to
have
parents
one
s
ashamed
of
i
think
i
blushed
i
m
sure
i
looked
away
to
avoid
seeing
her
expression
it
s
frightful
to
be
ashamed
of
one
s
parents
said
i
now
don
t
be
hypocritical
cried
she
you
know
perfectly
well
you
are
ashamed
of
your
parents
as
i
am
of
mine
i
ll
admit
said
i
that
if
they
showed
up
at
the
office
i
d
be
a
bit
upset
and
would
feel
apologetic
but
i
m
ashamed
of
myself
for
feeling
that
way
if
you
only
realized
about
things
said
she
which
was
her
phrase
for
hitting
at
me
as
lacking
in
refined
instincts
you
d
not
be
ashamed
of
yourself
but
would
frankly
suffer
they
are
a
disgrace
to
us
they
re
honest
people
well
meaning
and
as
good
as
the
best
in
every
essential
way
said
i
believe
me
edna
the
fault
isn
t
in
them
it
s
in
us
suppose
you
found
some
day
that
margot
was
ashamed
of
you
and
me
but
she
ll
not
be
retorted
edna
i
for
one
will
see
to
it
that
she
has
no
cause
to
be
anything
but
proud
i
couldn
t
but
admit
that
there
were
two
sides
to
the
problem
of
our
parents
it
was
shameful
to
be
ashamed
of
them
but
it
was
also
human
i
couldn
t
and
can
t
utterly
damn
in
edna
a
fault
a
vulgar
weakness
i
myself
had
and
almost
everyone
i
knew
no
doubt
gentle
reader
you
are
scandalized
and
disgusted
but
one
of
my
objects
in
relating
this
whole
story
is
to
scandalize
and
to
disgust
you
you
have
had
too
much
consideration
at
the
hands
of
writers
you
and
your
hypocritical
virtues
and
your
hysterical
nerves
if
you
are
an
american
you
are
probably
far
in
advance
of
your
parents
in
worldly
knowledge
in
education
in
every
way
except
perhaps
manly
and
womanly
self
respect
for
along
with
your
progress
has
come
an
infection
of
snobbishness
and
toadyism
that
seems
in
some
mysterious
way
inseparable
from
higher
civilization
so
be
shocked
and
disgusted
with
edna
and
me
and
don
t
turn
your
hypocritical
eyes
inward
on
your
own
secret
thoughts
and
actions
about
your
own
humble
parents
above
all
don
t
learn
from
this
horrifying
episode
a
decenter
mode
of
thinking
and
feeling
and
acting
we
must
get
them
out
of
the
way
before
we
move
to
new
york
said
edna
ever
since
margot
began
at
mrs
ryper
s
i
ve
been
on
pins
and
needles
you
don
t
know
how
malicious
fashionable
people
are
why
some
of
them
who
have
nothing
to
do
might
at
any
time
run
out
to
passaic
and
see
for
themselves
edna
was
sitting
up
in
my
lap
gazing
at
me
with
wide
harassed
looking
eyes
i
burst
out
laughing
they
might
take
a
camera
along
and
get
some
snapshots
i
suggested
edna
s
face
contracted
with
horror
and
her
form
grew
limp
and
weak
my
god
she
cried
so
they
might
godfrey
we
must
attend
to
it
at
once
iii
i
have
never
been
able
to
come
to
a
satisfactory
verdict
as
to
the
intelligence
of
the
human
race
is
it
stupid
or
is
it
rather
sluggish
is
it
unable
to
think
or
does
it
refuse
to
think
does
it
believe
the
follies
it
pretends
to
believe
and
usually
acts
upon
or
is
it
the
victim
of
its
own
willful
prejudices
and
hypocrisies
never
have
i
decided
that
a
certain
man
or
woman
was
practically
witless
but
that
he
or
she
has
confounded
me
by
saying
or
doing
something
indicating
shrewdness
or
even
wisdom
the
women
are
especially
difficult
to
judge
take
edna
for
example
it
was
impossible
to
interest
her
in
anything
worth
while
but
as
to
the
things
in
which
she
was
interested
none
could
have
thought
more
clearly
or
keenly
or
could
have
acted
with
more
vigor
and
effect
i
have
often
made
serious
blunders
inexcusable
blunders
in
managing
my
own
affairs
to
go
no
further
my
management
of
my
family
would
have
convicted
me
of
imbecility
before
any
court
not
made
up
of
good
natured
indifferent
woman
worshiping
woman
despising
american
husbands
yes
i
have
made
the
stupidest
blunders
in
all
creation
but
i
cannot
recall
a
single
notable
blunder
made
by
edna
in
the
matters
which
alone
she
deemed
worthy
of
her
attention
she
decided
what
she
wanted
she
moved
upon
it
by
the
best
route
whether
devious
or
direct
or
a
combination
of
the
two
and
she
always
got
it
you
may
say
her
success
was
due
to
the
fact
that
her
objects
were
trivial
but
if
you
will
think
a
moment
you
will
appreciate
that
a
thing
s
triviality
does
not
necessarily
make
it
easy
to
attain
as
much
energy
and
skill
may
be
shown
in
winning
a
sham
battle
as
in
winning
a
real
still
i
suppose
minds
are
cast
in
molds
of
various
sizes
and
one
cast
in
a
small
mold
can
deal
only
with
the
small
and
i
guess
that
from
whatever
cause
the
minds
of
women
are
of
diverse
kinds
of
smaller
molds
perhaps
this
is
the
result
of
bad
education
perhaps
better
education
will
correct
it
i
do
not
know
i
can
speak
only
of
what
is
of
edna
as
she
is
and
always
has
been
having
made
up
her
mind
to
fell
the
genealogical
tree
that
an
artificial
one
might
be
stood
up
in
its
place
she
lost
no
time
in
getting
into
action
it
was
on
the
sunday
following
our
talk
the
earliest
possible
day
that
she
took
me
for
the
first
visit
we
had
made
our
parents
in
nearly
three
years
we
had
sent
them
presents
we
had
written
them
letters
we
had
received
painfully
composed
and
ungrammatical
replies
these
received
both
for
edna
and
myself
at
my
office
because
she
feared
the
servants
would
pry
into
periodically
arriving
exhibits
of
illiteracy
we
had
written
them
of
coming
and
bringing
margot
with
us
we
had
received
suggestions
of
their
coming
to
see
us
which
edna
had
evaded
by
such
excuses
as
that
we
were
moving
or
that
she
or
margot
was
not
well
or
that
the
cook
had
abruptly
deserted
the
world
outside
passaic
was
a
vague
place
to
our
old
fathers
and
mothers
their
own
immediate
affairs
kept
them
busy
so
with
no
sense
of
deliberate
alienation
on
their
side
and
small
and
mildly
intermittent
sense
of
it
on
our
side
the
months
and
the
years
passed
without
our
seeing
one
another
edna
announced
to
me
the
intended
visit
only
an
hour
before
we
started
it
was
a
habit
of
hers
a
clever
habit
too
never
to
take
anyone
into
her
confidence
about
her
plans
until
the
right
moment
that
is
the
moment
when
execution
was
so
near
at
hand
that
discussion
would
seem
futile
at
a
quarter
before
nine
on
that
sunday
morning
she
said
don
t
dress
for
church
this
is
a
good
day
to
make
that
trip
to
passaic
we
ll
go
by
miss
ryper
s
for
margot
said
i
how
the
old
people
will
stare
when
they
see
her
edna
looked
at
me
as
if
i
had
suddenly
uncovered
unmistakable
evidence
of
my
insanity
then
i
who
had
clean
forgot
her
foolish
notions
remembered
but
why
not
i
urged
it
will
give
them
so
much
pleasure
trash
ejaculated
she
they
don
t
care
a
rap
about
her
they
can
t
as
they
ve
not
seen
her
since
she
was
a
baby
and
margot
would
suffer
horribly
i
think
it
would
be
wicked
to
give
a
sweet
happy
young
girl
a
horrible
shock
this
grotesque
view
of
the
effect
of
the
sight
of
grandparents
upon
a
grandchild
struck
me
as
amusing
but
there
was
no
echo
of
my
laughter
in
the
disgusted
face
of
my
wife
i
sobered
and
said
yes
it
would
give
her
a
shock
we
ve
made
a
mistake
bringing
her
up
in
that
way
too
late
to
discuss
it
now
said
edna
i
suppose
so
i
could
not
but
agree
i
guess
the
mischief
s
done
beyond
repair
said
edna
have
you
any
sense
of
of
them
being
your
father
and
mother
rather
said
i
my
childhood
is
very
vivid
to
me
and
not
at
all
disagreeable
it
seems
to
me
like
a
bad
dream
unreal
and
to
be
forgotten
as
quickly
as
i
can
she
said
this
with
a
fine
spiritual
look
in
her
eyes
and
i
must
say
that
edna
refined
delicately
beautiful
fashionably
dressed
speaking
her
english
with
an
elegant
accent
did
not
suggest
fusty
dusty
queer
looking
weeping
willie
with
his
hearse
and
funeral
coaches
his
embalming
apparatus
and
general
appearance
of
animated
casket
nor
yet
fat
sloppy
ma
wheatlands
always
in
faded
wrappers
and
with
holes
cut
in
her
shoes
for
her
bunions
wear
your
oldest
business
suit
said
edna
coming
back
to
earth
from
the
contemplation
of
her
own
elevation
and
grandeur
i
shall
dress
as
quietly
as
i
dare
we
mustn
t
arouse
the
suspicions
of
the
servants
edna
s
fooleries
amused
me
i
didn
t
then
appreciate
the
dangers
of
tolerating
and
laughing
at
the
bad
habits
of
a
fascinating
child
if
i
had
little
good
i
d
have
accomplished
i
suspect
however
i
got
myself
up
as
edna
directed
and
when
i
saw
how
it
irritated
her
i
stopped
making
such
remarks
as
shall
i
wear
a
collar
hadn
t
i
better
sneak
out
the
back
way
and
join
you
at
the
ferry
i
should
have
liked
to
get
some
fun
out
of
our
doings
that
would
have
taken
at
least
the
saw
edge
off
my
feelings
of
self
contempt
i
am
not
fond
of
hypocrisy
yet
for
that
one
occasion
i
should
have
welcomed
the
familiar
human
shamming
and
faking
in
such
matters
but
edna
would
put
the
thing
through
like
one
of
her
father
s
funerals
as
we
in
what
was
practically
disguise
issued
forth
she
said
loudly
enough
for
the
cocking
ear
of
a
maid
who
chanced
to
be
in
the
front
hall
anyhow
the
country
dust
won
t
spoil
these
clothes
i
m
so
glad
it
s
clear
how
charming
the
woods
will
look
just
enough
to
deceive
edna
expanded
upon
her
cleverness
in
never
saying
too
much
because
saying
too
much
always
started
people
especially
servants
to
thinking
but
she
abruptly
checked
her
flow
of
self
praise
as
we
seated
ourselves
in
the
ferry
and
she
looked
about
there
not
a
dozen
seats
away
loomed
our
cook
yes
no
mistake
it
was
our
mary
gotten
up
regardless
for
a
sunday
outing
do
you
see
mary
said
my
wife
she
s
the
most
conspicuous
female
in
sight
said
i
she
s
a
credit
to
us
i
must
have
been
mad
groaned
edna
to
give
her
a
holiday
always
the
way
i
never
do
a
generous
kind
hearted
thing
that
i
don
t
have
to
pay
for
it
i
don
t
follow
you
said
i
she
hates
us
explained
edna
cooks
irish
cooks
invariably
hate
the
families
they
draw
wages
from
she
s
dogging
us
nonsense
said
i
she
probably
hasn
t
even
seen
us
but
edna
was
not
listening
she
was
contriving
we
must
let
her
leave
the
boat
ahead
of
us
pretend
not
to
see
her
i
obeyed
orders
in
the
jersey
city
train
shed
we
lagging
behind
saw
her
take
a
train
bound
for
a
different
destination
from
ours
much
relieved
edna
led
the
way
to
the
passaic
train
hardly
were
we
seated
when
in
at
the
door
of
the
coach
hurried
our
mary
excited
and
blown
she
came
beaming
down
the
aisle
edna
saluted
her
graciously
and
calmly
i
got
in
the
wrong
train
said
mary
it
d
never
have
took
me
nowheres
near
my
cousin
in
passaic
edna
s
composure
was
admirable
said
i
when
mary
had
passed
on
now
what
my
dear
you
see
she
is
dogging
us
replied
edna
i
ve
not
a
doubt
she
knows
all
about
us
i
don
t
think
she
s
got
a
camera
said
i
still
they
make
them
very
small
nowadays
we
shall
have
to
go
on
in
the
train
and
return
home
from
the
station
beyond
said
edna
do
as
you
like
said
i
but
as
for
me
i
get
off
at
passaic
and
go
to
see
the
old
folks
please
stop
your
joking
said
edna
if
you
had
any
pride
you
couldn
t
joke
i
am
serious
said
i
i
shall
go
to
see
mother
and
father
no
doubt
her
cousin
lives
in
the
same
part
of
the
slums
said
edna
oh
it
is
hideous
i
don
t
know
what
possessed
me
whether
a
fit
of
indigestion
and
obstinacy
or
a
sudden
access
of
sense
of
decency
as
i
approached
my
old
home
whatever
it
was
it
moved
me
to
say
my
dear
this
nonsense
has
gone
far
enough
we
will
do
what
we
set
out
to
do
not
i
said
edna
then
i
ll
drop
off
at
passaic
alone
and
hire
a
trap
and
give
mary
a
seat
in
it
as
far
as
her
cousin
s
i
m
not
proud
of
my
parents
the
more
shame
to
me
but
there
s
a
limit
to
my
ability
to
degrade
myself
edna
and
i
had
not
lived
together
all
those
years
without
her
learning
the
tone
i
use
when
i
will
not
be
trifled
with
she
did
not
argue
she
sat
silent
and
pale
beside
me
when
the
train
stopped
at
passaic
she
followed
me
from
the
car
mary
descended
ahead
of
us
and
moved
off
at
as
brisk
a
pace
as
tight
corsets
and
stiff
new
shoes
would
permit
in
a
direction
exactly
opposite
that
we
were
to
take
aren
t
you
glad
we
didn
t
go
on
said
i
eager
to
make
it
up
she
made
no
reply
she
maintained
haughty
and
injured
silence
until
we
were
within
sight
of
the
houses
then
she
said
curtly
i
ll
do
the
talking
about
our
plans
for
them
that
ll
be
best
said
i
most
conciliatory
i
had
not
intended
to
say
this
there
had
been
a
half
formed
resolution
in
my
mind
to
oppose
those
plans
but
her
anger
roused
in
me
such
a
desire
to
pacify
her
that
i
promptly
yielded
where
i
must
in
honesty
confess
i
was
little
short
of
indifferent
american
husbands
have
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
docile
and
the
worst
henpecked
men
in
the
world
all
foreigners
say
so
and
our
women
believe
it
in
fact
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
the
docility
of
american
husbands
is
the
good
nature
of
indifference
a
friend
of
mine
has
the
habit
of
saying
that
his
most
valued
and
most
valuable
possession
is
his
long
list
of
things
he
cares
not
a
rap
about
it
is
a
typically
american
and
luminous
remark
the
men
of
other
nations
agitate
over
trifles
love
to
have
the
sense
of
being
master
at
home
usually
their
one
and
only
chance
for
a
free
swing
at
the
joyous
feeling
of
being
boss
the
american
man
absorbed
in
his
important
work
at
office
or
factory
and
not
caring
especially
about
anything
else
lets
thieving
politicians
rule
in
public
affairs
lets
foolish
incompetent
women
rule
in
domestic
affairs
he
has
a
half
conscious
philosophy
that
he
is
shrewd
enough
if
he
attends
to
his
business
to
make
money
faster
than
they
can
take
it
away
from
him
and
that
if
he
does
not
attend
to
his
business
only
he
will
have
nothing
either
for
thieving
politician
and
spendthrift
wife
or
for
himself
if
you
wish
to
discover
how
little
there
is
in
the
notion
of
his
docility
meddle
with
something
he
really
cares
about
many
a
political
rascal
many
a
shiftless
wife
has
done
it
and
has
gotten
a
highly
disagreeable
surprise
perhaps
what
i
saw
had
as
much
to
do
with
my
tame
acquiescence
in
my
wife
s
projects
as
my
desire
to
have
peace
between
her
and
me
when
peace
meant
yielding
what
only
a
vague
and
feeble
filial
impulse
moved
me
to
contest
i
had
what
i
thought
was
a
clear
and
vivid
memory
of
my
natal
place
and
edna
s
how
the
two
houses
looked
how
small
and
shabby
they
were
how
mean
their
surroundings
how
plain
their
interiors
but
as
we
drove
up
i
discovered
that
memory
had
been
pleasantly
deceiving
me
could
these
squalid
hovels
these
tiny
hideous
boxes
set
in
two
dismal
weedy
oblongs
of
unkempt
yards
could
these
be
our
old
homes
and
the
bent
old
laboring
man
and
his
wife
we
had
drawn
up
in
front
of
my
home
could
they
be
my
father
and
my
mother
a
feeling
of
sickness
of
nausea
came
over
me
not
from
repulsion
for
my
parents
thank
god
i
had
not
sunk
that
low
but
from
abhorrence
of
myself
so
degraded
by
the
higher
world
into
which
prosperity
and
edna
s
ambitions
had
dragged
me
that
i
could
look
down
upon
the
gentle
old
man
and
the
patient
loving
old
woman
to
whom
i
owed
life
and
a
fair
start
in
the
world
my
blood
burned
and
my
eyes
sank
as
they
greeted
me
their
homely
old
hands
trembling
their
mouths
distorted
by
emotion
and
age
and
missing
teeth
i
turned
away
while
they
were
kissing
edna
for
i
felt
i
should
hate
her
and
loathe
myself
if
i
saw
the
expression
that
must
be
in
her
face
there
are
my
father
and
mother
she
cried
in
a
suffocating
voice
and
we
three
lorings
were
watching
her
hurry
across
the
yard
and
through
the
gap
in
the
fence
between
the
two
places
my
sister
came
forward
we
kissed
each
other
as
awkwardly
as
two
strangers
i
looked
at
her
dazedly
mary
our
cook
was
an
imposing
looking
lady
beside
this
thin
haired
coarse
featured
old
maid
in
embarrassed
silence
we
four
entered
the
house
i
am
not
tall
nor
in
the
least
fat
yet
i
had
an
uncontrollable
impulse
to
stoop
and
to
squeeze
as
i
entered
the
squat
and
narrow
doorway
that
miserable
little
parlor
as
we
sat
silent
my
roving
glance
at
last
sought
my
mother
s
face
oh
the
faces
the
masks
with
which
freakish
and
so
often
savagely
ironic
fate
covers
and
hides
our
souls
making
fair
seem
foul
and
foul
seem
fair
making
beauty
repellent
and
ugliness
seem
beautiful
suddenly
through
that
plain
time
and
toil
scarred
mask
through
those
dim
sunken
eyes
i
saw
her
soul
her
mother
s
heart
looking
at
me
and
the
tears
poured
into
my
eyes
mother
i
sobbed
in
a
choking
voice
and
i
put
my
arms
round
her
and
nestled
against
her
heart
a
boy
again
a
bad
boy
with
a
streak
of
good
in
him
i
felt
how
proud
she
they
all
were
of
me
the
son
and
brother
who
had
gone
forth
and
fulfilled
the
universal
american
dream
of
getting
up
in
the
world
i
hoped
i
prayed
that
they
would
not
realize
what
a
poor
creature
i
was
with
my
snobbish
shame
there
was
an
awkward
rambling
attempt
at
talk
but
we
had
nothing
to
talk
about
nothing
in
common
i
happened
to
think
of
our
not
having
brought
margot
how
shameful
it
was
yet
how
glad
i
felt
and
how
self
contemptuous
for
being
glad
to
break
that
awful
silence
i
enlarged
upon
margot
her
beauty
her
cleverness
she
must
be
like
polly
my
sister
s
name
was
polly
like
polly
was
at
her
age
observed
my
mother
i
looked
at
polly
ann
in
whose
faded
face
and
withered
form
faded
and
withered
though
she
was
not
yet
forty
was
in
fact
but
seven
or
eight
years
older
than
i
like
polly
i
could
speak
no
more
of
margot
the
delicate
loveliness
of
a
rare
carefully
reared
hot
house
exotic
yes
exotic
for
the
girls
and
the
women
brought
up
in
the
super
refinements
of
prosperous
class
silliness
seem
foreign
to
this
world
and
are
a
few
minutes
that
seemed
hours
and
edna
came
in
her
father
and
mother
limping
and
hobbling
in
her
train
edna
was
sickly
pale
and
her
eyelids
refused
to
rise
i
shook
hands
with
old
willie
wheatlands
hesitated
then
kissed
the
fat
sallow
swinging
cheek
of
my
mother
in
law
said
edna
in
a
hard
forced
voice
i
ve
explained
that
margot
isn
t
well
and
that
we
ve
got
to
get
back
mercy
me
cried
my
mother
ain
t
you
going
to
stay
to
supper
supper
it
was
only
half
past
twelve
supper
could
not
be
until
five
or
half
past
we
had
been
there
half
an
hour
and
already
conversation
was
exhausted
and
time
had
become
motionless
we
intended
to
said
edna
but
margot
wasn
t
at
all
well
when
we
left
we
simply
can
t
stay
away
long
we
d
not
have
come
but
we
felt
we
d
never
get
here
if
we
kept
on
letting
things
interfere
you
didn
t
leave
margy
alone
demanded
edna
s
mother
almost
said
edna
only
a
a
servant
oh
you
keep
a
nurse
girl
too
said
polly
i
thought
edna
didn
t
look
as
if
she
did
any
of
her
own
work
yes
i
have
a
a
girl
in
addition
to
the
cook
replied
edna
flushing
as
she
thus
denied
three
of
her
five
servants
flushing
not
because
of
the
denial
but
because
in
her
confession
she
had
almost
forgotten
about
the
numerous
excuses
based
on
the
cook
godfrey
has
been
doing
very
well
and
we
felt
we
could
afford
it
better
get
rid
of
her
advised
old
willie
sourly
and
of
the
cook
too
servant
girls
is
mighty
wasteful
and
she
ll
teach
margy
badness
said
my
mother
them
servants
is
full
of
poison
even
if
yer
pa
d
had
money
i
d
never
have
allowed
no
servant
round
my
children
no
more
n
a
snake
in
the
cradle
i
hope
she
s
a
good
christian
and
not
a
catholic
she
s
all
right
declared
edna
nervously
but
we
ll
have
to
be
going
soon
yes
that
there
girl
might
git
drunk
said
mrs
wheatlands
and
set
fire
to
the
house
maybe
said
my
mother
i
heard
of
a
case
just
last
week
i
wish
you
hadn
t
said
that
cried
edna
her
tones
of
protest
more
like
jubilation
i
ll
be
wretched
until
i
m
home
again
mother
told
in
detail
and
with
rising
excitement
the
story
of
the
drunken
nurse
girl
who
had
burned
up
herself
and
her
charges
a
pair
of
lovely
twins
from
that
moment
our
families
were
anxious
for
us
to
go
the
three
women
could
see
the
girl
drunk
and
the
house
burning
the
two
grandfathers
while
less
imaginative
were
almost
as
uneasy
besides
no
doubt
our
families
found
us
full
as
tiring
as
we
found
them
but
before
we
go
said
edna
in
a
business
like
tone
there
s
one
thing
we
wanted
to
talk
about
godfrey
has
had
that
is
he
has
done
very
well
in
business
and
of
course
our
first
thought
one
of
our
first
thoughts
was
what
could
we
do
for
you
all
down
here
we
hate
to
think
of
your
living
in
this
unhealthful
part
of
the
town
we
want
to
see
you
settled
in
some
healthful
place
up
in
the
hills
we
were
watching
the
faces
of
our
five
kinsfolk
we
could
make
nothing
of
their
expression
it
was
heavy
dull
mere
listening
without
a
hint
of
even
comprehension
behind
we
thought
you
father
and
mr
father
loring
might
look
round
and
find
a
nice
farm
with
a
big
comfortable
house
plenty
big
enough
for
you
all
and
godfrey
will
buy
it
and
will
pay
for
a
man
and
a
woman
to
look
after
you
he
has
done
well
as
i
said
and
he
can
afford
it
in
fact
they
ve
made
him
president
of
the
railroad
my
father
my
mother
and
my
sister
exchanged
glances
a
long
awed
silence
old
willie
spoke
in
his
squeaky
stingy
voice
i
can
t
leave
my
business
i
ain
t
footless
like
loring
there
my
business
pays
you
can
sell
it
said
edna
you
know
you
ought
to
retire
you
were
telling
me
how
bad
your
health
had
been
nobody
else
couldn
t
make
nothing
like
what
i
make
out
of
it
the
men
growing
up
nowadays
ain
t
no
account
the
no
account
women
with
heads
full
of
foolishness
leads
em
off
edna
agreed
with
him
pointed
out
that
he
d
have
to
give
up
soon
anyhow
appealed
to
his
cupidity
for
real
estate
by
expanding
upon
the
size
and
value
of
the
farm
i
was
willing
to
give
him
she
made
a
strong
impression
the
women
were
converted
by
the
prospect
of
having
help
with
the
work
my
father
had
long
dreamed
of
a
home
in
the
country
he
had
not
the
imagination
to
picture
how
he
would
be
bored
away
from
the
loafers
with
whom
he
talked
politics
and
religion
and
said
edna
you
ll
have
horses
and
things
to
ride
in
so
you
can
go
where
you
please
whenever
you
please
we
had
roused
them
we
had
dazzled
them
it
was
plain
that
if
a
purchaser
could
be
found
for
the
wheatlands
undertaking
business
edna
would
carry
her
point
godfrey
will
look
for
somebody
to
take
the
business
said
she
to
her
father
i
want
you
and
father
loring
to
start
out
to
morrow
morning
and
not
stop
till
you
ve
found
a
farm
i
understood
an
uncertain
gleam
in
old
willie
s
eyes
about
the
price
said
i
speaking
for
the
first
time
i
m
willing
to
pay
twenty
five
thousand
down
for
the
place
alone
and
as
i
ll
pay
cash
you
ought
to
be
able
on
mortgage
to
get
a
farm
or
two
or
three
adjoining
farms
that
would
cost
twice
that
the
two
families
were
dumbfounded
i
know
i
can
trust
you
mr
wheatlands
to
get
the
money
s
worth
buy
a
big
place
said
edna
of
the
unexpected
timely
shrewdnesses
go
back
from
the
main
roads
where
land
s
so
dear
wheatlands
nodded
that
s
a
good
idea
said
he
there
ll
be
plenty
of
roads
after
a
while
edna
was
ready
to
depart
then
it
s
settled
said
she
her
father
nodded
i
m
willing
to
see
what
can
be
done
but
i
d
rather
not
have
ben
loring
along
he
d
interfere
with
a
good
bargain
yes
you
go
alone
willie
said
my
father
anyhow
i
ve
got
to
tend
store
i
can
t
afford
a
boy
any
more
the
mention
of
the
to
them
enormous
sum
of
money
had
put
them
in
a
state
of
awe
as
to
edna
and
me
it
saddened
me
to
observe
how
quickly
the
weed
of
snobbishness
whose
seeds
are
in
all
human
nature
sprang
up
and
dominated
the
whole
garden
they
lost
the
sense
of
our
blood
kinship
with
them
they
felt
that
we
able
to
dispense
such
splendid
largess
were
of
a
superior
order
of
being
and
i
saw
that
my
and
edna
s
feeling
of
strangeness
toward
them
was
intimacy
beside
the
feeling
of
strangeness
toward
us
which
they
now
had
in
my
dealings
with
my
fellow
beings
i
have
often
noted
this
sort
of
thing
that
the
snobbishness
of
those
who
look
down
is
a
weak
and
hesitating
impulse
which
would
soon
die
out
but
for
the
encouragement
it
gets
from
the
snobbishness
of
those
who
look
up
i
read
somewhere
caste
is
made
by
those
who
look
up
not
by
those
who
look
down
that
is
a
great
truth
and
like
most
great
simple
obvious
truths
is
usually
overlooked
looking
back
i
see
that
my
own
first
decisive
impulse
toward
the
caste
feeling
came
that
day
came
when
my
people
and
edna
s
discovering
that
we
were
rich
began
to
treat
us
as
lower
class
treats
upper
class
my
mother
had
been
scrutinizing
me
for
signs
of
the
majesty
of
wealth
why
don
t
you
wear
a
beard
or
leastways
a
mustache
godfrey
she
finally
inquired
then
you
wouldn
t
seem
so
boyish
like
i
used
to
wear
a
mustache
said
i
but
i
cut
it
off
because
i
don
t
recall
why
in
fact
i
did
recall
i
noted
one
day
that
i
had
a
good
mouth
and
better
teeth
than
most
men
have
and
it
came
to
me
how
absurd
it
was
to
hang
a
bunch
of
hair
from
my
upper
lip
to
trail
in
the
soup
and
to
embalm
the
odors
of
past
cigars
for
the
discomfort
of
my
nose
edna
kept
after
me
for
a
time
to
let
it
grow
again
but
reading
in
some
novel
she
regarded
as
authoritative
that
mustaches
were
common
she
desisted
and
i
found
my
boyish
appearance
highly
useful
it
led
men
to
underestimate
me
a
signal
advantage
in
the
contests
of
wit
against
wit
in
which
i
daily
engaged
with
a
view
to
wrenching
a
fortune
for
myself
away
from
my
fellow
men
my
mother
went
on
to
urge
me
to
make
my
face
look
older
and
more
formidable
now
that
she
had
learned
what
a
grand
person
i
was
she
feared
others
would
not
realize
it
edna
who
as
i
have
said
was
shrewdness
personified
where
her
own
interests
were
involved
immediately
saw
the
dangerous
bearings
of
this
newly
aroused
vanity
of
our
kin
i
forgot
to
caution
you
said
she
not
to
mention
our
prosperity
if
we
were
talked
about
now
it
might
be
lost
entirely
the
only
reason
godfrey
and
i
came
to
you
so
soon
with
the
news
of
it
was
because
we
wanted
to
do
something
for
you
right
away
and
we
knew
we
could
trust
you
not
to
get
us
into
trouble
don
t
talk
about
us
if
you
hear
people
talking
if
they
ask
you
questions
pretend
you
don
t
understand
and
don
t
know
you
see
it
may
be
spies
from
our
enemies
one
glance
round
that
circle
of
eager
faces
was
enough
to
convince
that
edna
had
made
precisely
the
impression
she
desired
i
could
see
that
my
mother
and
old
weeping
willie
the
shrewd
of
the
five
the
two
to
whom
edna
and
i
owed
most
by
inheritance
were
prepared
to
deny
knowing
us
if
that
would
aid
in
safeguarding
the
precious
prosperity
my
father
and
sister
were
obviously
disappointed
that
they
could
not
go
about
boasting
of
our
magnificence
and
getting
from
the
neighbors
the
envy
and
respect
due
the
near
relations
of
a
plutocrat
but
there
was
no
danger
of
their
being
indiscreet
edna
could
breathe
freely
and
when
the
two
families
were
tucked
away
in
the
midst
of
a
large
and
secluded
farm
she
could
tell
what
genealogical
stories
she
pleased
without
fear
of
being
confounded
by
the
truth
by
three
o
clock
we
were
back
in
brooklyn
edna
felt
and
looked
triumphant
the
crowning
of
the
day
s
work
had
been
small
but
significant
a
heavy
rain
storm
that
came
up
while
we
were
on
the
way
back
must
have
made
the
servants
think
we
had
cut
short
our
woodland
outing
as
we
were
going
to
bed
that
might
edna
roused
herself
from
deep
study
and
broke
a
long
silence
with
i
hesitated
whether
to
tell
them
you
had
become
president
of
the
road
i
had
noted
that
seeming
slip
of
hers
so
unlike
her
cautious
reticence
then
i
remembered
they
d
be
sure
to
see
it
in
the
papers
continued
she
and
i
decided
it
was
best
to
tell
and
quiet
them
while
the
old
folks
were
industriously
settling
themselves
in
the
new
jersey
woods
here
let
me
relieve
my
mind
by
saying
a
few
words
in
mitigation
of
the
unfilial
and
snobbish
conduct
of
edna
and
me
i
admit
we
deserve
nothing
but
condemnation
i
admit
i
am
more
to
blame
than
she
because
i
could
have
compelled
her
to
act
better
toward
our
families
though
of
course
i
could
not
have
changed
her
feelings
or
my
own
for
that
matter
but
as
often
happens
in
this
world
the
thing
that
was
in
motive
shameful
turned
out
well
we
and
our
families
had
grown
hopelessly
apart
intercourse
with
them
could
not
but
have
been
embarrassing
and
uncomfortable
for
both
sides
when
we
got
them
the
farm
got
them
away
from
the
malarial
and
squalid
part
of
passaic
into
a
healthful
region
where
they
lived
in
much
better
health
and
in
a
comfort
they
could
appreciate
we
did
the
best
possible
thing
for
them
as
well
as
for
ourselves
do
not
think
for
a
moment
that
because
i
am
ashamed
of
my
snobbish
motives
i
am
therefore
advocating
the
keeping
up
of
irksome
and
absurd
ties
merely
out
of
wormy
sentimentality
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
when
we
have
but
the
one
chance
at
life
the
one
chance
to
make
the
best
of
our
talents
and
opportunities
that
only
moral
or
mental
weakness
or
both
would
waste
the
one
chance
in
the
bondage
of
outworn
ties
when
one
has
outgrown
any
association
lop
it
off
relentlessly
say
i
if
the
living
lets
the
dying
cling
to
it
the
dying
does
not
live
but
the
living
dies
if
you
are
associated
with
anyone
in
any
way
business
social
ties
of
affection
whatever
you
please
and
if
you
do
not
wish
to
lose
that
one
then
keep
yourself
alive
and
abreast
of
him
or
her
and
if
you
let
yourself
begin
to
decay
and
find
yourself
cut
away
whose
is
the
fault
if
fault
there
be
we
edna
and
i
perhaps
did
not
do
all
we
might
to
make
our
outgrown
families
happy
i
say
perhaps
though
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
we
did
not
do
all
that
was
in
our
power
for
they
certainly
would
have
got
no
pleasure
out
of
seeing
more
of
two
people
so
uncongenial
to
them
in
every
respect
at
any
rate
we
did
not
leave
our
families
to
starve
or
to
suffer
hard
though
my
charming
lovely
wife
was
i
cannot
conceive
her
sinking
to
that
depth
on
the
whole
i
feel
that
we
could
honestly
say
we
took
the
right
course
with
them
that
is
we
helped
them
without
hindering
ourselves
we
did
the
right
thing
though
not
in
the
right
way
while
our
families
were
choosing
a
farm
were
fixing
up
the
buildings
to
suit
their
needs
and
tastes
were
moving
themselves
from
their
ancient
haunts
edna
was
as
industriously
busy
making
far
deeper
inroads
on
the
new
prosperity
she
was
planning
the
conquest
of
new
york
every
day
in
the
year
many
a
suddenly
enriched
family
is
busy
about
the
same
enterprise
families
from
the
less
fashionable
parts
of
the
city
moving
to
the
fashionable
parts

from
other
cities
and
towns
east
west
north
and
south
advancing
to
social
conquest

the
leadership
of
mammas
and
daughters
tired
of
shining
in
obscure
monotonous
and
unappreciative
places
there
are
i
forget
how
many
thousands
of
millionaires
on
manhattan
island
enough
i
know
with
the
near
millionaires
and
those

four

thousand
not
including

all
of
these
have
the
fashionable
craze
at
least
they
haven
t
it
in
its
worst
form
the
form
in
which
it
possessed
my
wife
all
the
acute
sufferers
must
find
suitable
lodgments
near
fifth
avenue
if
not
in
it
now
new
york
is
ever
ready
to
receive
and
to
trim
the
arriving
millionaire
it
has
all
kinds
of
houses
and
apartments
to
meet
the
peculiarities
of
his
or
rather
of
his
wife
s
and
daughter
s
notions
of
grandeur
it
has
a
multitude
of
purveyors
of
furnishings
and
decorations
likewise
designed
to
catch
crude
and
grandiose
tastes
my
wife
was
busy
with
these
gentry
don
t
you
think
we
d
better
go
a
little
slow
said
i
why
not
live
in
a
hotel
on
manhattan
and
look
about
us
i
had
respect
for
my
wife
s
capacity
at
the
woman
side
of
the
game
she
had
thoroughly
drilled
me
to
more
than
generous
appreciation
of
it
but
at
the
same
time
i
was
not
so
blinded
by
her
charm
for
me
or
so
convinced
by
her
insistent
and
plausible
egotism
that
i
had
not
noted
certain
minor
failures
of
hers
due
to
her
ignorance
of
the
art
of
spending
money
she
was
clever
at
learning
but
often
her
vanity
lured
her
into
fancying
she
knew
when
in
fact
her
education
in
that
particular
direction
was
all
miseducation
she
dressed
much
more
giddily
in
our
first
years
in
brooklyn
than
she
did
afterwards
and
in
the
later
years
she
made
still
further
discoveries
as
to
dress
that
resulted
in
another
revolution
away
from
quietness
not
toward
the
gaudy
but
toward
smartness
that
curious
quality
which
makes
a
woman
s
toilet
conspicuous
without
the
least
suggestion
of
the
loud
however
edna
scorned
my
suggestion
that
she
make
haste
slowly
she
had
long
been
engaged
in
a
thorough
study
of
the
mode
of
life
in
millionairedom
newspapers
sunday
supplements
magazines
and
society
novels
had
helped
her
she
had
examined
the
exteriors
of
the
famous
palaces
she
had
got
into
the
drawing
rooms
and
ballrooms
of
two
or
three
palaces
by
way
of
high
priced
charity
tickets
she
had
in
one
instance
roamed
into
sitting
rooms
bedrooms
bathrooms
until
caught
and
led
back
by
some
vigilant
and
unbribable
servant
i
wonder
if
she
ever
recalls
that
adventure
now
probably
not
i
think
i
have
recorded
her
ability
absolutely
to
forget
whatever
it
pleases
her
not
to
remember
she
had
been
educating
herself
so
when
i
suggested
caution
she
replied
don
t
you
fret
godfrey
i
know
what
i
m
about
i
ll
get
what
we
ve
got
to
have
and
i
ll
concede
that
she
did
also
that
i
thought
it
overwhelmingly
grand
at
the
time
it
was
a
house
in
a
fashionable
side
street
between
madison
avenue
and
fifth
a
magnificent
house
built
for
exactly
such
a
family
as
mine
that
is
it
was
built
entirely
for
show
and
not
at
all
for
comfort
it
fairly
bristled
with
the
luxuries
and
modern
conveniences
but
most
of
them
were
of
the
sort
that
looks
comfortable
but
is
not
the
rent
was
some
preposterous
sum
thirty
five
or
forty
thousand
a
year
we
had
room
enough
for
the
housing
of
nearly
a
hundred
people
counting
servants
as
people
which
i
believe
is
not
the
custom
it
was
fitted
throughout
in
the
fashion
which
those
clever
leeches
who
think
out
and
sell
luxuries
have
in
all
ages
imposed
upon
the
rich
man
because
it
means
money
in
their
pockets
once
in
a
while
you
find
a
rich
man
who
has
the
courage
to
live
as
he
pleases
but
most
of
them
live
as
the
fashion
commands
and
many
of
them
have
no
idea
that
there
is
any
less
comfortless
and
less
foolish
way
to
live
you
imagine
gentle
reader
that
people
with
money
live
in
beauty
and
comfort
you
imagine
that
you
could
do
it
also
if
you
had
but
the
wealth
believe
me
you
deceive
yourself
beyond
question
a
certain
amount
of
money
is
necessary
to
the
getting
of
attractive
and
comfortable
surroundings
but
there
is
another
an
equally
indispensable
and
a
far
rarer
factor
that
factor
gentle
reader
is
intelligence
knowledge
of
the
resources
of
civilization
knowledge
of
the
realities
as
to
comfort
luxury
and
taste
i
am
tempted
to
linger
upon
the
details
of
the
extravagance
of
that
first
big
establishment
of
edna
s
it
was
so
astounding
and
so
ridiculous
i
saw
that
she
had
delivered
us
and
our
fortune
over
to
hordes
of
crafty
thirsty
bloodsuckers
merchants
tradesmen
servants
but
her
heart
was
set
upon
it
and
all
other
rich
people
were
living
in
that
same
way
you
want
to
do
the
right
thing
by
margot
don
t
you
said
she
by
you
and
margot
said
i
go
ahead
i
guess
i
can
find
the
money
i
shan
t
here
go
into
the
ways
i
discovered
or
invented
for
finding
that
money
they
were
not
too
scrupulous
but
neither
were
they
commercially
dishonorable
i
must
smile
there
being
of
an
inquiring
and
jocose
mind
i
have
often
tried
to
find
an
action
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
most
eminent
commercial
authorities
was
absolutely
dishonorable
never
yet
have
i
found
a
single
action
however
wrong
and
even
criminal
in
general
that
they
would
not
declare
in
certain
circumstances
perfectly
honorable
and
those
certain
circumstances
could
always
be
boiled
down
to
the
one
circumstance
needing
the
money
i
can
t
recall
exactly
how
many
servants
we
had
to
wait
on
us
two
but
it
was
about
thirty
five
i
remember
hearing
my
wife
say
one
month
that
our
meat
bill
alone
was
about
a
thousand
dollars
for
a
time
i
fancied
we
were
living
more
grandly
than
anyone
else
in
town
but
it
soon
revealed
itself
to
me
that
as
things
went
with
our
class
we
were
leading
rather
a
simple
life
certainly
nothing
we
did
marked
us
out
from
the
others
in
that
region
the
sum
totals
suggested
that
servants
stood
at
the
front
windows
all
day
long
tossing
money
into
the
street
but
nothing
of
the
kind
occurred
you
would
have
said
we
ate
the
finest
food
in
wholesale
quantities
yet
never
did
i
get
a
notably
good
meal
at
my
own
house
the
coffee
was
always
poor
the
fruit
was
below
the
average
of
sidewalk
stands
we
often
had
cold
storage
fowls
and
fish
on
the
table
we
paid
for
the
best
i
m
sure
we
paid
for
it
many
times
over
we
got
what
one
always
gets
when
the
wife
is
too
intellectual
and
too
busy
to
attend
to
her
business
but
i
assure
you
it
was
grandly
served
the
linen
and
the
dishes
were
royal
the
servants
were
in
liveries
of
impressive
color
and
form
though
i
could
have
wished
that
my
wife
had
been
as
sensitive
to
odors
as
i
was
and
had
compelled
some
of
those
magnificent
gentry
to
do
a
little
bathing
throughout
the
establishment
the
same
superb
scale
was
maintained
we
lived
like
the
rest
of
the
millionaires
neither
better
nor
worse
we
lived
in
grandeur
and
discomfort
but
my
wife
was
ecstatic
and
i
was
therefore
content
yes
we
were
very
grand
and
as
in
brooklyn
the
glasses
came
to
the
table
with
a
certain
sour
odor
not
alluring
as
you
lifted
them
to
drink
the
odor
that
causes
an
observant
man
or
woman
to
say
aha
dirty
rags
in
this
perfect
lady
s
kitchen
dirty
rags
and
all
that
goes
with
them
but
only
a
snarling
cynic
would
complain
of
these
vulgar
trifles
there
s
always
at
least
a
fly
leg
in
the
ointment
didn
t
i
tell
you
i
knew
what
i
was
about
said
edna
triumphantly
you
did
said
i
haven
t
we
got
what
we
wanted
we
have
said
i
perhaps
somewhat
abruptly
for
i
was
just
then
wondering
how
the
devil
we
were
going
to
keep
it
and
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
me
proceeded
she
we
d
still
be
living
in
brooklyn
or
in
passaic
said
i
don
t
speak
of
passaic
she
cried
i
m
trying
to
forget
it
we
were
very
happy
then
said
i
i
was
miserable
retorted
she
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
wish
we
weren
t
always
attended
by
servants
said
i
i
almost
never
see
you
alone
what
a
bourgeois
you
are
laughed
she
then
after
a
thorough
glance
round
to
make
sure
housekeeper
or
maid
or
lackey
wasn
t
on
watch
she
patted
my
cheek
and
kissed
me
and
added
but
you
do
make
me
happy
i
m
so
proud
of
you
no
matter
what
i
want
i
m
never
afraid
to
buy
it
for
i
know
you
can
get
all
the
money
you
want
to
i
winced
said
i
i
m
afraid
you
d
not
be
proud
of
some
of
the
ways
i
get
the
money
she
frowned
don
t
talk
business
please
she
said
you
know
we
never
have
in
all
our
married
life
you
ve
always
respected
my
position
as
your
wife
all
business
is
low
is
mere
sordidness
yes
it
s
all
low
said
i
sometimes
i
think
all
living
is
low
as
well
edna
i
put
my
arm
round
her
don
t
you
ever
feel
that
we
d
be
really
happy
that
we
d
get
something
genuine
out
of
life
if
you
and
margot
and
i
she
stopped
my
mouth
with
a
kiss
you
never
will
grow
up
to
your
station
darling
i
said
no
more
indeed
it
was
on
hastiest
impulse
that
i
had
said
so
much
an
impulse
sprung
from
a
mood
of
depression
the
cause
of
that
mood
was
a
nasty
reverse
in
wall
street
it
had
rudely
halted
me
in
my
triumphant
way
toward
the
security
of
the
man
of
many
millions
it
had
set
me
to
wavering
uncertainly
with
the
chances
about
even
for
resuming
the
march
and
for
tumbling
into
the
abyss
of
a
discreditable
bankruptcy
there
are
in
new
york
two
well
defined
classes
of
the
rich
the
permanently
rich
and
the
precariously
rich
the
permanently
rich
are
those
who
by
the
vastness
of
their
wealth
or
by
the
strength
of
their
business
and
social
connections
cannot
possibly
be
dislodged
from
the
plutocracy
the
precariously
rich
are
those
who
have
much
money
and
are
making
more
but
are
not
strong
enough
to
survive
a
series
of
typhoons
and
are
without
the
support
of
indissoluble
business
and
social
connections
my
friend
g
for
example
head
of
the
famous
banking
house
associated
in
business
and
by
marriage
with
half
the
permanent
plutocracy
was
practically
bankrupt
in
the
late
panic
had
he
been
a
man
of
ordinary
position
he
would
have
gone
into
bankruptcy
and
i
more
than
suspect
into
jail
but
his
fellow
plutocrats
dared
not
let
him
drop
much
as
they
would
have
liked
to
see
his
arrogance
brought
low
much
as
they
longed
to
divide
among
themselves
his
holdings
of
gilt
edged
securities
if
he
had
gone
down
it
would
have
made
the
whole
financial
world
tremble
he
was
saved
on
the
other
hand
my
friend
j
richer
actually
was
ruined
was
plucked
by
his
associates
was
finally
jailed
for
doing
precisely
the
things
every
man
of
finance
did
over
and
over
again
in
that
same
period
of
stress
for
what
invariably
happens
to
moral
codes
in
periods
of
stress
i
was
at
that
time
but
not
now
gentle
reader
so
cheer
up
and
read
on
i
was
at
that
time
in
the
class
not
of
the
permanently
but
of
the
precariously
rich
and
through
a
miscalculation
i
had
laid
myself
open
to
the
dangers
that
lie
in
wait
for
the
man
short
of
ready
cash
the
miscalculation
was
as
to
the
extravagance
of
my
wife
s
undertakings
she
against
my
express
request
had
contracted
without
consulting
or
telling
me
several
enormous
bills
it
is
idle
to
say
she
ought
not
have
done
this
i
knew
her
well
i
should
have
been
on
guard
i
had
begun
my
married
life
wrong
as
the
young
man
very
much
in
love
is
apt
to
do
so
to
hold
her
love
and
liking
i
had
to
keep
on
giving
her
taste
for
spending
money
free
rein
if
i
had
not
she
would
have
thought
me
small
and
mean
would
have
made
life
at
home
exceedingly
uncomfortable
for
me
for
i
am
not
of
those
men
who
can
take
from
a
woman
what
they
wish
whether
she
wishes
to
give
or
not
so
the
whole
fault
was
mine
when
the
storm
broke
in
the
light
of
its
first
terrific
flash
that
illuminated
for
me
every
part
of
my
affairs
i
discovered
that
i
was
not
prepared
as
i
had
been
imagining
the
big
bills
of
my
wife
were
presented
for
the
merchants
knew
i
was
heavily
interested
in
the
stocks
that
were
tobogganing
those
bills
had
to
be
paid
and
paid
at
once
or
it
would
run
like
wildfire
uptown
and
down
that
i
was
in
difficulties
and
when
a
man
is
known
to
be
in
financial
difficulties
how
the
birds
and
beasts
of
prey
from
eagles
and
lions
to
buzzards
and
jackals
do
come
flapping
and
loping
there
followed
several
anxious
days
and
nights
on
one
of
those
nights
i
rose
from
beside
my
wife
we
still
slept
together
and
went
into
the
adjoining
room
i
turned
on
an
electric
light
and
began
for
the
thousandth
time
i
dare
say
to
look
at
the
critical
papers
and
to
grope
for
the
desperate
way
out
i
was
startled
by
my
wife
s
voice
sleepy
peevish
do
turn
out
that
light
and
come
to
bed
godfrey
you
know
how
it
disturbs
me
for
you
to
get
up
in
the
night
and
i
ve
such
a
hard
day
before
me
to
morrow
with
the
upholsterers
and
curtain
people
i
obediently
turned
off
the
light
as
i
was
about
to
throw
myself
into
bed
and
draw
the
covers
over
me
a
broad
beam
from
the
moon
flooded
the
face
of
a
portrait
on
the
opposite
wall
the
face
of
my
daughter
margot
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
looked
at
that
face
pure
sweet
with
the
same
elevated
expression
her
mother
had
in
these
days
of
refinement
and
climbing
said
i
to
edna
are
you
asleep
dear
no
she
answered
crossly
i
m
waiting
for
you
to
quiet
down
then
let
me
talk
to
you
a
few
minutes
oh
please
she
cried
flinging
herself
to
the
far
edge
of
the
bed
you
have
no
consideration
for
me
none
at
all
listen
i
said
i
m
face
to
face
with
ruin
she
did
not
move
or
speak
but
i
could
feel
her
intense
attention
if
i
let
matters
take
their
course
i
can
save
my
reputation
and
my
official
position
but
for
many
years
we
ll
have
to
live
quietly
about
as
we
did
in
brooklyn
i
can
t
do
that
cried
she
the
fall
would
kill
me
you
know
how
proud
i
am
just
as
i
had
everything
ready
for
us
to
get
into
society
godfrey
how
could
you
and
i
thought
you
were
clever
at
business
i
could
not
see
her
nor
she
me
except
in
dimmest
outline
i
said
but
we
d
have
each
other
and
margot
and
my
salary
isn
t
so
small
as
salaries
go
isn
t
there
any
way
to
avoid
it
she
was
sitting
up
in
bed
her
nervous
fingers
upon
my
arm
you
must
think
godfrey
you
mustn
t
play
margot
and
me
this
horrible
trick
you
mustn
t
give
up
so
easily
you
must
think
think
think
i
have
said
i
i
ve
not
slept
for
three
days
and
nights
there
s
no
way
no
honest
way
then
there
is
a
way
she
cried
but
not
an
honest
one
she
laughed
scornfully
and
you
pretend
to
love
me
when
my
life
and
margot
s
happiness
are
at
stake
you
talk
like
a
sunday
school
boy
yes
said
i
and
i
ve
been
thinking
more
or
less
that
way
lately
for
the
first
time
in
years
it
wasn
t
long
after
i
started
when
i
cut
my
business
eye
teeth
i
found
out
that
as
the
game
lay
i
d
not
get
far
if
i
stuck
to
the
old
maxims
of
the
copy
book
and
the
sunday
school
except
by
accident
nobody
ever
got
rich
who
followed
them
to
get
rich
you
ve
got
to
make
a
lot
of
people
work
for
you
and
work
cheap
and
you
ve
got
to
sell
what
they
make
as
dear
as
you
can
success
in
business
means
taking
advantage
of
the
ignorance
or
the
necessities
of
your
fellow
men
or
both
don
t
waste
time
talking
that
kind
of
nonsense
said
she
impatiently
it
doesn
t
mean
anything
to
me
or
to
anybody
i
guess
the
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
put
your
mind
on
the
real
thing
how
to
save
your
family
and
yourself
that
s
what
i
m
talking
about
said
i
i
m
talking
about
saving
myself
and
my
family
as
i
told
you
my
troubles
the
first
business
troubles
i
ve
ever
had
have
set
me
to
thinking
i
ve
not
been
doing
right
all
these
years
it
s
true
everybody
does
as
i
ve
been
doing
it
s
true
i
ve
been
more
generous
and
more
considerate
than
most
men
with
opportunities
and
the
sense
to
see
them
but
i
ve
been
doing
wrong
i
paused
hoping
for
some
sign
of
sympathy
none
came
i
went
on
and
i
ve
been
wondering
these
last
few
days
if
by
doing
it
i
haven
t
been
ruining
myself
and
my
family
not
financially
but
in
more
important
ways
edna
what
s
the
sense
in
this
life
we
re
leading
what
will
be
the
end
of
it
all
is
there
any
decency
or
happiness
in
it
haven
t
we
been
going
backward
instead
of
forward
all
the
time
i
was
talking
i
could
feel
she
was
not
listening
when
i
finished
she
said
godfrey
what
is
this
way
you
can
escape
by
i
can
sell
out
my
partners
in
the
deals
that
have
gone
bad
perhaps
they
re
selling
you
out
she
instantly
suggested
why
of
course
they
are
doing
that
very
thing
while
you
are
driveling
about
honesty
like
a
backwoods
hypocrite
of
a
church
deacon
no
they
re
not
selling
me
out
said
i
how
do
you
know
cried
she
i
caught
them
at
that
trick
in
a
former
deal
and
in
the
early
stages
of
this
one
and
i
fixed
things
so
that
while
they
have
to
trust
me
i
don
t
trust
them
she
laughed
mockingly
godfrey
i
think
your
mind
must
be
going
you
talking
about
sacrificing
your
fortune
and
your
wife
and
your
child
for
men
who
ve
tried
to
ruin
you
men
who
are
even
now
thinking
out
some
scheme
for
doing
it
suppose
you
saved
yourself
and
let
them
go
what
then
wouldn
t
you
be
rich
and
when
you
were
secure
again
couldn
t
you
pay
them
back
what
they
lost
if
you
were
still
foolish
enough
to
think
it
necessary
it
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
astonished
me
with
the
depth
of
her
practical
insight
and
her
skill
at
logic
when
she
cared
to
use
her
mind
i
had
thought
of
saving
myself
and
paying
back
afterwards
said
i
but
i
m
not
sure
i
d
save
myself
it
s
simply
my
one
chance
then
you
ve
got
to
take
that
chance
said
she
i
didn
t
expect
you
to
talk
like
this
said
i
the
only
reason
i
haven
t
spoken
of
my
troubles
before
was
that
i
feared
you
d
forbid
me
to
do
what
i
was
being
tempted
to
do
and
that
was
the
truth
about
my
feeling
i
had
always
heard
and
had
firmly
believed
that
woman
was
somehow
the
exemplar
of
ideal
morality
that
it
was
she
who
kept
men
from
being
worse
than
they
were
that
the
evil
being
done
by
men
pursuing
success
was
done
without
the
knowledge
of
their
pure
idealist
wives
and
mothers
and
daughters
i
can
t
account
for
my
stupidity
in
this
respect
had
i
not
on
every
side
the
spectacle
that
gave
the
lie
to
the
shallow
pretense
of
feminine
moral
superiority
was
it
not
the
women
with
their
insatiable
appetite
for
luxury
and
splurge
was
it
not
the
women
with
their
incessant
demands
for
money
and
ever
more
money
was
it
not
the
women
with
their
profound
immorality
of
any
and
every
class
that
earns
nothing
and
simply
spends
was
it
not
the
women
the
ladies
who
were
edging
on
the
men
to
get
money
no
matter
how
for
whom
were
the
grand
houses
the
expensive
hotels
the
exorbitant
flimsy
clothing
the
costly
jewelry
the
equipages
the
opera
boxes
the
senseless
spendthrift
squandering
upon
the
degrading
vanities
of
social
position
i
laughed
somewhat
cynically
no
wonder
you
ve
always
refused
to
learn
anything
about
business
said
i
it
s
a
habit
among
big
business
men
to
refuse
to
know
anything
as
to
the
details
of
a
large
transaction
that
can
be
carried
through
only
by
dirty
work
if
we
don
t
know
we
can
pretend
that
the
dirty
work
isn
t
being
done
by
or
for
us
isn
t
being
done
at
all
now
you
are
getting
coarse
said
my
wife
do
you
know
what
i
think
of
you
i
could
not
see
her
expression
but
the
voice
always
betrays
if
there
is
insincerity
because
we
do
not
deal
enough
with
the
blind
to
learn
to
deceive
perfectly
with
the
voice
her
tones
were
absolutely
sincere
as
she
answered
her
own
question
i
think
it
is
cowardly
of
you
to
come
to
me
with
your
business
troubles
if
you
were
brave
you
d
simply
have
quietly
done
whatever
was
necessary
to
save
your
family
yes
it
is
cowardly
i
didn
t
mean
it
as
cowardice
said
i
admiring
but
irritated
by
this
characteristic
adroitness
in
the
stories
and
the
plays
that
give
such
thrills
the
husband
in
the
crisis
and
tempted
to
do
wrong
appeals
to
his
wife
and
they
are
brought
closer
together
and
she
helps
him
to
do
right
and
everything
ends
happily
again
i
laughed
good
humoredly
it
doesn
t
seem
to
be
turning
out
that
way
does
it
dear
my
heavenly
picture
of
you
and
margot
and
me
living
modestly
and
making
up
in
love
what
we
lack
in
luxury
it
doesn
t
attract
you
she
said
in
her
patient
superior
tone
i
suppose
you
never
will
understand
me
or
my
ideals
what
you
ve
been
doing
in
annoying
me
with
your
business
it
s
as
if
when
i
was
giving
a
dinner
i
assembled
my
guests
and
compelled
them
to
watch
all
the
preparations
for
the
dinner
the
killing
of
the
lambs
and
the
fish
and
the
birds
the
cleaning
all
those
ugly
and
low
things
bringing
business
into
the
home
and
the
social
life
it
s
like
bringing
the
kitchen
into
the
drawing
room
the
obvious
answer
to
this
shallow
but
plausible
and
attractive
cleverness
of
hers
did
not
come
to
me
then
if
it
had
i
d
not
have
spoken
it
for
of
what
use
to
argue
with
the
human
animal
female
or
male
about
its
dearest
selfishnesses
and
vanities
of
what
use
to
point
out
to
human
self
complacence
greediness
and
hypocrisy
that
a
refined
and
cultured
existence
of
ease
and
luxury
can
be
obtained
only
by
the
theft
and
murder
of
dishonest
business
that
for
one
man
to
be
vastly
rich
thousands
of
men
must
somehow
be
robbed
and
oppressed
even
though
the
rich
man
himself
directly
does
no
robbing
and
oppressing
if
i
have
sucking
pig
for
dinner
i
kill
sucking
pig
as
surely
as
if
my
hand
wielded
the
knife
of
the
butcher
but
the
human
race
finds
it
convenient
and
comfortable
not
to
think
so
therefore
let
us
not
bother
our
heads
about
it
at
that
period
of
my
career
i
had
not
thought
things
out
so
thoroughly
as
i
have
since
in
these
days
when
events
have
compelled
me
to
open
my
eyes
and
to
see
in
my
hypocrisy
in
my
eagerness
to
save
myself
i
was
not
loth
to
take
refuge
behind
the
advice
given
by
my
wife
partly
in
genuine
ignorance
of
business
partly
in
pretended
ignorance
of
it
said
i
i
suppose
you
re
right
i
ought
to
think
only
of
my
family
heaven
knows
my
rascal
friends
aren
t
thinking
in
my
interest
if
i
don
t
do
it
no
one
will
there
s
no
disputing
that
eh
no
reply
she
was
asleep
or
rather
was
pretending
to
be
asleep
the
matter
had
been
settled
why
discuss
it
further
why
expose
herself
longer
than
unavoidable
to
the
danger
of
being
unable
to
be
or
to
pretend
to
be
ignorant
of
business
of
the
foundation
upon
which
her
splendid
cultured
structure
of
ambition
proudly
reared
often
in
her
sleep
her
hand
would
seek
mine
and
when
it
was
comfortably
nestled
she
would
give
a
little
sigh
of
content
that
thrilled
me
through
and
through
her
hand
now
stole
into
mine
and
the
sigh
of
content
came
softly
from
her
lips
my
love
i
murmured
kissing
her
cheek
before
i
lay
down
how
could
i
for
a
minute
have
considered
any
course
that
would
have
made
her
unhappy
that
might
have
lessened
perhaps
destroyed
her
love
for
me
iv
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
i
threw
overboard
my
partners
and
saved
myself
indeed
i
emerged
from
the
crisis
liberally
bespattered
with
mud
it
is
true
but
richer
than
when
i
entered
it
since
i
was
doing
the
act
that
was
the
supreme
proof
of
my
possessing
the
courage
and
the
skill
for
leadership
in
business
since
i
was
definitely
breaking
with
the
old
fashioned
morality
i
felt
it
was
the
part
of
wisdom
to
do
the
thing
so
thoroughly
so
profitably
that
instead
of
being
execrated
i
should
be
admired
there
were
attacks
on
me
in
the
newspapers
there
were
painful
interviews
with
my
partners
not
so
painful
to
me
as
they
would
have
been
had
i
not
been
able
to
remind
them
of
their
own
unsuccessful
treacheries
and
to
enforce
the
spoken
reminder
with
the
documentary
proof
but
on
the
whole
i
came
off
excellently
well
as
who
does
not
that
gets
away
with
the
goods
in
these
days
of
increased
intelligence
and
consequent
lessened
hypocrisy
the
big
business
man
is
the
object
of
only
perfunctory
hypocrisies
from
outraged
morality
it
has
been
discovered
that
the
farmer
watering
his
milk
or
the
grocer
using
solder
mended
scales
is
as
bad
as
the
man
who
reorganizes
a
railway
or
manipulates
a
stock
is
worse
actually
because
the
massed
mischief
of
the
million
little
business
rascals
is
greater
than
the
sensational
misdeeds
of
the
few
great
rascals
it
has
been
discovered
that
human
nature
is
good
or
bad
only
according
to
the
opportunities
and
necessities
not
according
to
abstract
moral
standards
and
the
cry
is
no
longer
kill
the
scoundrel
but
that
fellow
had
the
sense
to
outwit
us
we
must
learn
from
him
how
to
sharpen
our
wits
so
that
we
won
t
let
ourselves
be
robbed
a
healthful
sign
this
that
masses
of
men
are
ceasing
from
twaddle
about
vague
ideals
and
are
educating
themselves
in
practical
horse
sense
it
may
be
that
some
day
the
honest
husbandman
will
learn
to
guard
his
granary
not
only
against
the
robber
with
the
sack
in
the
dark
of
the
morn
but
also
against
the
rats
and
mice
who
pilfer
ten
bushels
to
every
one
that
is
stolen
of
one
thing
i
am
certain
until
men
learn
to
take
heed
in
the
small
they
will
remain
easy
prey
in
the
large
far
from
doing
me
harm
my
bold
stroke
was
of
the
greatest
benefit
from
the
standpoint
of
material
success
and
that
is
the
only
point
of
view
i
am
here
considering
it
did
me
as
much
good
with
the
world
as
it
has
done
me
with
you
gentle
reader
for
while
you
are
exclaiming
against
my
wickedness
you
are
in
your
secret
heart
confessing
that
if
i
had
chosen
the
ideally
honest
course
had
retired
to
obscurity
and
poverty
you
would
have
approved
and
would
have
lost
interest
in
me
why
if
i
had
chosen
that
ideal
course
i
doubt
not
i
should
have
lost
my
railway
position
my
directors
would
have
waxed
enthusiastic
over
my
old
fashioned
honesty
and
would
have
looked
round
for
another
and
shrewder
and
stronger
man
to
whom
to
intrust
the
management
of
their
railway
which
would
not
pay
dividends
were
it
run
along
the
lines
of
old
fashioned
honesty
the
outburst
of
denunciation
soon
spent
itself
like
a
summer
storm
beating
the
giant
cliffs
of
a
mountain
of
what
use
to
rage
futilely
against
my
splendid
immovable
fortune
the
attacks
the
talk
about
my
bold
stroke
the
exaggerations
of
the
size
of
the
fortune
i
had
made
all
served
to
attract
attention
to
me
to
make
me
a
formidable
and
an
interesting
figure
i
leaped
from
obscurity
into
fame
and
power
and
i
had
the
money
to
maintain
the
position
i
had
won
long
before
indeed
as
soon
as
we
moved
to
manhattan
my
wife
had
joined
fashionable
and
exclusive
holy
cross
church
and
had
plunged
straightway
into
its
charity
work
a
highly
important
part
of
her
brooklyn
education
had
been
got
in
st
mary
s
in
learning
how
to
do
charity
work
and
how
to
make
it
count
socially
edna
genuinely
loved
charity
work
she
loved
to
patronize
loved
to
receive
those
fawning
blessings
and
handkissings
which
city
poverty
becomes
adept
at
giving
the
rich
it
lives
off
of
the
poor
family
understands
perfectly
that
the
rich
visit
and
help
not
through
mere
empty
sentimental
nonsense
of
brotherhood
but
to
have
their
vanities
tickled
in
exchange
for
the
graciousness
of
their
condescending
presence
and
for
the
money
they
lay
out
as
the
poor
want
the
money
and
have
no
objection
to
paying
for
it
with
that
cheap
and
plentiful
commodity
cringing
scantily
screening
mockery
and
contempt
rich
and
poor

most
comfortably
in
our
cities
not

alone
but
any
center
of

for
human
nature
is
the
same
city
and
country
san
francisco
bangor
pekin
or
paris
for
that
matter
there
is
a
shallow
fashion
of
describing
this
or
that
as

usually
snobbishness
or

it

in
no

peculiar
nor
is
any
other

new

is
nothing
but
the
epitome
of
the

our
two
universal
cities
there
you
find
in
one
place

in
admirable
perspective
a
complete
museum
of
specimens
of
what

over
three
and
a
half

miles

not

it
is
four
million

all

the
dominant
force
of

no
more
dominant
in
new
york
than
it
is
in
the
rest
of

new

is
more
truly
representative
of
america
than
is
chicago
for
in
chicago
the
eastern

i
was
telling
of
my
wife
s
blossoming
as
lady
bountiful
in
search
not
of
a
heavenly
crown
but
of
what
human
lady
bountiful
always
seeks
social
position
charity
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
the
greatest
of
them
is
hypocrisy
i
have
yet
to
see
a
charitable
man
or
woman
or
child
whose
chief
and
only
noteworthy
object
was
not
self
glorification
the
people
who
believe
in
brotherhood
do
not
go
in
for
charity
they
wish
to
abolish
poverty
whereas
charity
revels
in
poverty
and
seeks
to
increase
it
to
change
it
from
miserable
poverty
which
might
die
into
comfortable
pauperism
which
can
live
on
and
fester
and
breed
on
and
fawn
on
and
give
vanity
ever
more
and
more
exquisite
titillations
holy

my
wife
s
new
spiritual
guide
was
past
master
of
the
pauper
making
and
pauper
utilizing
arts
its
rector
and
his
staff
of
slimy
sycophants
had
the
small
standing
army
of
its
worthy
poor
trained
to
perfection
when
my
wife
went
down
among
them
she
returned
home
with
face
aglow
and
eyes
heavenly
what
a
treat
those
wretches
had
given
her
and
in
the
first
blush
of
her
enthusiasm
she
dispensed
lavishly
where
the
older
members
of
the
church
exacted
the
full
measure
of
titillation
for
every
dollar
invested
and
awarded
extra
sums
only
to
some
novelty
in
lickspittling
or
toadeating
were
i
not
sure
i
should
quite
wear
out
the
forbearance
of
gentle
reader
i
should
linger
to
describe
this
marvelous
charity
plant
for
providing
idle
or
social
position
hunting
rich
women
with
spiritual
pleasures
i
had
almost
said
debaucheries
but
that
would
be
intruding
my
private
and
perhaps
prejudiced
opinion
i
have
no
desire
to
irritate
much
less
shake
the
faith
of
those
who
believe
in
holy
cross
and
its
uplift
work
and
i
don
t
suppose
holy
cross
does
any
great
amount
of
harm
the
poor
who
prostitute
themselves
to
its
purposes
are
weak
things
beyond
redemption
as
for
the
rich
who
waste
time
and
money
there
would
they
not
simply
waste
elsewhere
were
there
no
holy
cross
my
wife
was
at
that
time
a
very
ignorant
woman
thinly
covered
with
a
veneer
of
what
i
now
know
was
a
rather
low
grade
of
culture
that
veneer
impressed
me
it
had
impressed
our
brooklyn
friends
of
st
mary
s
but
i
fancy
it
must
have
looked
cheap
to
expert
eyes
where
her
surpassing
shrewdness
showed
itself
was
in
that
she
herself
recognized
her
own
shortcomings
rare
and
precious
is
the
vanity
that
comforts
and
sustains
without
self
deception
she
knew
she
wasn
t
the
real
thing
knew
she
had
not
yet
got
hold
of
the
real
thing
and
when
she
began
to
move
about
cautiously
and
quietly
in
holy
cross
she
realized
that
at
last
she
was
in
the
presence
of
the
real
thing
my
big
responsibilities
my
associations
in
finance
had
been
giving
me
a
superb
training
in
worldly
wisdom
i
think
i
had
almost
as
strong
a
natural
aptitude
for
catching
on
to
the
better
thing
in
speech
and
manner
and
in
dress
as
had
edna
it
is
not
self
flattery
for
me
to
say
that
up
to
the
holy
cross
period
i
was
further
advanced
than
she
certainly
i
ought
to
have
been
for
a
man
has
a
much
better
opportunity
than
a
woman
and
one
of
the
essentials
of
equipment
for
great
affairs
is
ability
to
observe
accurately
the
little
no
less
than
the
large
looking
back
i
recall
things
which
lead
me
to
suspect
that
edna
saw
my
superiority
in
certain
matters
most
important
to
her
and
was
irritated
by
it
however
that
may
be
a
few
months
in
holy
cross
and
she
had
grasped
the
essentials
of
the
social
art
as
i
or
any
other
masculine
man
never
could
grasp
it
and
her
veneer
of
middle
class
culture
disappeared
under
a
thick
and
enduring
coating
of
the
best
new
york
manner
what
has
become
of
you
i
said
to
her
i
haven
t
seen
you
in
weeks
i
don
t
understand
said
she
ruffling
as
she
always
did
when
she
suspected
me
of
indulging
in
my
coarse
and
detestable
sense
of
humor
why
you
don
t
act
like
yourself
at
all
said
i
even
when
we
re
alone
you
give
the
uncomfortable
sense
of
dressed
up
not
as
if
you
were
dressed
up
but
as
if
i
were
i
feel
like
a
plowboy
before
a
princess
she
was
delighted
you
i
went
on
are
now
exactly
like
the
rest
of
those
women
in
holy
cross
i
suppose
it
s
all
right
to
look
and
talk
and
act
that
way
before
people
at
least
i
ve
no
objection
if
it
pleases
you
but
for
heaven
s
sake
edna
don
t
spoil
our
privacy
with
it
the
queen
doesn
t
wear
her
coronation
robes
all
the
time
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
said
she
don
t
you
cried
i
laughing
what
a
charming
fraud
you
are
and
i
seized
her
in
my
arms
and
kissed
her
and
she
seemed
to
yield
and
to
return
my
caresses
but
i
was
uncomfortable
she
would
not
drop
that
new
manner
the
incident
seems
trifling
enough
perhaps
it
was
trifling
but
it
stands
out
in
my
memory
it
marks
the
change
in
our
relationship
i
recall
it
all
distinctly
how
she
looked
how
young
and
charming
and
cold
what
she
was
wearing
the
delicate
simple
dress
that
ought
to
have
made
her
most
alluring
to
me
yet
made
me
feel
as
if
she
were
indeed
alluring
but
not
for
me
a
subtle
difference
there
but
abysmal
the
difference
between
the
woman
who
tries
to
make
herself
attractive
for
the
sake
of
her
husband
and
the
woman
who
makes
toilets
in
the
conscious
or
half
conscious
longing
successfully
to
prostitute
herself
to
the
eyes
of
the
public
i
recall
every
detail
of
that
incident
yet
i
have
only
the
vaguest
recollection
of
our
beginning
to
occupy
separate
bedrooms
by
that
time
the
feeling
of
alienation
must
have
grown
so
strong
that
i
took
the
radical
change
in
our
habits
as
the
matter
of
course
many
are
the
women
in
all
parts
of
the
earth
who
have
sought
to
climb
into
the
world
of
fashion
by
the
broad
and
apparently
easy
stairway
of
charity
but
most
of
them
have
failed
because
they
were
unaware
of
the
secret
of
that
stairway
an
unsuspected
secret
which
i
shall
proceed
to
point
out
it
seems
as
i
have
said
a
particularly
easy
stairway
broad
roomy
with
invalid
steps
it
is
in
fact
a
moving
stairway
so
cunningly
contrived
that
she
it
is
usually
she
who
ascends
keeps
in
the
same
place
she
goes
up
but
at
exactly
her
ascending
rate
the
stairway
goes
down
she
sees
other
women
making
apparently
no
more
effort
than
she
ascending
rapidly
and
presently
entering
the
earthly
heaven
at
the
top
yet
there
she
stands
marking
time
moving
not
one
inch
upward
and
there
she
will
stand
until
she
wearies
relaxes
her
efforts
and
finds
herself
rapidly
descending
but
how
do
the
women
who
ascend
accomplish
it
i
do
not
know
you
must
ask
them
i
only
know
the
cause
of
the
failure
of
the
women
who
do
not
ascend
if
i
knew
why
the
others
succeeded
i
should
not
tell
it
i
would
not
deprive
fashionable
women
of
the
joy
of
occupying
a
difficult
height
from
which
they
can
indulge
themselves
in
the
happiness
of
sneering
and
spitting
down
at
their
lowlier
sisters
and
i
have
no
sympathy
with
the
aspirations
or
the
humiliations
of
those
lowlier
sisters
my
energetic
and
aspiring
wife
presently
found
herself
on
this
stairway
with
no
hint
as
to
its
secret
much
less
as
to
the
way
of
overcoming
its
peculiarity
she
toiled
daily
in
holy
cross
she
subscribed
to
everything
she
helped
in
everything
she
was
the
proud
recipient
of
the
rector
s
loud
praises
as
his
most
devoted
least
worldly
most
spiritual
helper
but
not
an
invitation
of
the
kind
she
wanted
everyone
was
just
lovely
to
her
whenever
any
charitable
or
spiritual
matter
was
to
be
discussed
no
matter
how
grand
and
exclusive
the
house
in
which
the
discussion
was
to
be
held
there
was
my
wife
in
a
place
of
honor
eagerly
consulted
and
urged
to
subscribe
but
nothing
unworldly
they
understood
how
spiritual
she
was
did
those
sweet
good
people
they
knew
saint
edna
wished
no
social
frivolities
no
dinners
or
theater
parties
no
bridge
or
dancing
she
was
a
wise
lady
she
hid
her
burning
impatience
she
smiled
and
purred
when
she
yearned
to
scowl
and
scratch
she
waited
and
prayed
for
some
lucky
accident
that
would
swing
her
across
the
invisible
apparently
nonexistent
but
actually
impassable
dead
line
she
had
expected
snubs
and
cold
shoulders
never
a
snub
never
a
cold
shoulder
always
smiles
and
gracious
handshakings
and
amiable
familiarities
but
those
always
of
the
kind
that
serve
to
accentuate
caste
distinction
instead
of
removing
it
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
i
think
she
was
completely
stumped
she
could
combat
obstacles
she
might
even
have
found
a
way
to
fight
fog
but
how
ridiculous
to
make
struggles
and
thrust
out
fists
when
there
is
nothing
but
empty
sunny
air
she
held
church
lunches
and
dinners
at
our
house
of
course
had
me
on
duty
at
the
dinners
all
in
vain
the
distinction
between
the
spiritual
and
the
temporal
remained
in
force
the
grand
people
came
acted
as
if
they
were
delighted
complimented
her
on
her
house
on
her
hospitality
went
away
to
invite
her
to
similar
dreary
functions
at
their
houses
and
my
how
it
did
cost
her
no
wonder
holy
cross
made
a
pet
of
her
and
elected
me
to
the
board
of
vestrymen
once
in
a
while
she
would
find
something
in
her
net
so
slyly
cast
so
softly
drawn
she
would
have
a
wild
spasm
of
joy
then
the
something
would
turn
out
to
be
another
climber
like
herself
those
climbers
avoided
each
other
as
devils
dodge
the
font
of
holy
water
the
climber
she
would
have
caught
would
be
one
who
ignorant
of
the
intricacies
of
new
york
society
was
under
the
impression
that
the
mrs
godfrey
loring
so
conspicuous
in
holy
cross
must
be
a
social
personage
they
would
examine
each
other
at
a
series
of
joyous
entertainments
each
would
provide
for
the
other
would
discover
their
mutual
mistake
and
you
know
the
contemptuous
toss
with
which
the
fisherman
rids
himself
of
a
bloater
you
know
the
hysterical
leap
of
the
released
bloater
back
into
the
water
but
how
it
was
funny
my
wife
did
not
take
me
into
her
confidence
as
to
her
social
struggles
she
maintained
with
me
the
same
sweet
elegant
exterior
of
spiritual
placidity
with
which
she
faced
the
rest
of
the
world
nevertheless
in
a
dim
sort
of
way
i
had
some
notion
of
what
she
was
about
though
as
i
was
presently
to
discover
i
was
wholly
mistaken
in
my
idea
of
her
progress
what
has
happened
to
mrs
lestrange
i
said
to
her
one
evening
at
dinner
is
she
ill
she
cast
a
quick
nervous
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
butler
i
looking
at
him
by
way
of
a
mirror
thought
i
saw
upon
his
aristocratic
countenance
a
faint
trace
of
that
insolent
secret
glee
which
fills
servants
when
their
betters
are
humiliated
before
them
mrs
lestrange
she
said
carelessly
oh
i
see
her
now
and
then
but
you
ve
been
inseparable
until
lately
said
i
a
quarrel
i
suppose
not
at
all
said
my
wife
tartly
and
she
shifted
abruptly
to
another
subject
when
i
went
to
the
little
study
adjoining
my
sitting
room
to
smoke
she
came
with
me
there
she
said
please
don
t
mention
mrs
lestrange
before
the
servants
again
why
what
s
up
said
i
did
she
turn
out
to
be
a
crook
heavens
no
how
coarse
you
are
godfrey
simply
that
i
was
terribly
mistaken
in
her
she
looked
like
a
confidence
woman
or
a
madam
said
i
didn
t
you
tell
me
she
was
a
howling
swell
i
thought
she
was
said
my
wife
and
i
knew
something
important
was
coming
only
that
theory
would
account
for
her
admitting
she
had
made
a
mistake
and
in
a
way
she
was
but
they
caught
her
several
years
ago
taking
money
to
get
some
dreadful
low
western
people
into
society
since
then
she
s
asked
she
herself
because
she
s
well
connected
and
amusing
but
she
can
t
help
anyone
else
oh
i
see
said
i
and
you
don
t
feel
strong
enough
socially
as
yet
to
be
able
to
afford
the
luxury
of
her
friendship
strong
enough
said
edna
with
intense
bitterness
i
have
no
position
at
all
none
whatever
i
was
surprised
for
until
that
moment
i
had
been
assuming
she
was
on
or
near
the
top
of
the
wave
moving
swiftly
toward
triumphant
success
you
want
too
much
said
i
you
ve
really
got
all
there
is
to
get
at
that
last
reception
of
yours
you
had
all
the
heavy
swells
my
valet
told
me
so
reception
to
raise
funds
for
the
orphanage
said
edna
with
a
vicious
sneer
the
unloveliest
expression
i
had
ever
seen
on
her
lovely
face
and
i
had
seen
not
a
few
unlovely
expressions
there
in
our
many
married
years
some
of
them
extremely
trying
years
i
tell
you
i
am
nobody
socially
they
take
my
money
for
their
rotten
old
charities
they
use
me
for
their
tiresome
church
work
and
they
do
nothing
for
me
nothing
how
i
hate
them
i
sat
smoking
my
cigar
and
watching
her
face
it
was
a
wonderfully
young
face
not
that
she
was
so
old
on
the
contrary
she
was
still
young
in
years
i
call
her
face
wonderfully
young
because
it
had
that
look
of
inexhaustible
eternal
youth
which
is
rare
even
in
the
faces
of
boys
and
girls
but
that
evening
i
was
not
thinking
so
much
of
her
youth
and
her
beauty
as
of
a
certain
expression
of
hardness
of
evil
passions
rampant
envy
and
hatred
and
jealousy
savage
disappointment
over
defeats
in
sordid
battles
edna
said
i
hesitatingly
why
don
t
you
drop
all
that
can
t
you
see
there
s
nothing
in
it
you
re
tempting
the
worst
things
in
your
nature
to
grow
and
destroy
all
that
s
good
and
sweet
all
that
makes
you
and
me
happy
people
aren
t
necessary
to
us
and
if
you
must
have
friends
surely
all
the
attractive
people
in
new
york
aren
t
in
that
little
fashionable
set
judging
from
what
i
ve
seen
of
them
they
re
a
lot
of
bores
they
look
bored
here
retorted
she
and
no
wonder
they
come
as
a
christian
duty
i
laughed
now
honestly
are
those
fashionable
people
the
best
educated
the
best
in
any
way
any
real
way
i
ve
talked
with
the
men
and
the
younger
ones
the
ones
that
go
in
for
society
are
unspeakable
rotters
i
wouldn
t
have
them
about
edna
s
eyes
flashed
and
her
form
quivered
in
a
gust
of
hysterical
fury
the
breaking
of
long
pent
passion
of
anger
and
despair
taking
me
as
an
excuse
for
vent
oh
it
s
terrible
to
be
married
to
a
man
who
always
misunderstands
one
who
can
t
sympathize
cried
she
it
was
a
remark
she
often
made
but
never
before
had
she
put
so
much
energy
so
much
bitterness
into
it
what
do
i
misunderstand
i
asked
more
hurt
than
i
cared
to
show
where
don
t
i
sympathize
let
s
not
talk
about
it
exclaimed
she
if
i
weren
t
a
remarkable
woman
i
d
have
given
up
long
ago
i
d
give
up
now
before
you
smile
at
her
egotism
gentle
reader
please
remember
that
husband
and
wife
were
talking
alone
also
that
with
a
few
pitiful
exceptions
all
human
beings
think
surpassingly
well
of
themselves
and
do
not
hesitate
to
express
that
good
opinion
privately
i
guess
there
s
more
lying
done
about
lack
of
egotism
and
of
vanity
generally
than
about
all
other
matters
put
together
said
i
you
are
indeed
a
wonder
dear
in
this
country
one
sees
many
astonishing
transformations
but
i
doubt
if
there
have
been
many
equal
to
the
transformation
of
the
girl
i
married
into
the
girl
who
s
sitting
before
me
and
what
good
has
it
done
me
demanded
she
how
i
ve
worked
away
at
myself
inside
and
out
and
all
for
nothing
you
ve
still
got
me
said
i
jovially
yet
in
earnest
too
lots
of
women
lose
their
husbands
i
ve
never
had
a
single
impulse
to
wander
in
the
candor
of
that
intimacy
she
gave
me
a
most
unflattering
look
a
look
a
woman
does
well
not
to
cast
at
a
man
unless
she
is
more
absolutely
sure
of
him
than
anyone
can
be
of
anything
in
this
uncertain
world
i
laughed
as
if
i
thought
she
meant
that
look
as
a
jest
i
put
the
look
away
in
my
memory
with
a
mark
on
it
that
meant
to
be
taken
out
and
examined
at
leisure
but
she
was
absorbed
in
her
chagrin
over
her
social
failure
she
probably
hardly
realized
i
was
there
well
what
s
the
next
move
inquired
i
presently
you
ve
got
to
help
replied
she
and
i
knew
this
was
what
she
had
been
revolving
in
her
mind
all
evening
anything
that
doesn
t
take
me
away
from
business
or
keep
me
up
too
late
to
fit
myself
for
the
next
day
business
always
business
said
she
in
deepest
disgust
do
you
never
think
of
anything
else
my
business
and
my
family
that
s
my
life
said
i
not
your
family
replied
she
you
care
nothing
about
them
edna
i
said
sharply
that
is
unjust
and
untrue
oh
you
give
them
money
if
that
s
what
you
mean
said
she
disdainfully
and
i
give
them
love
said
i
the
trouble
is
i
give
so
freely
that
you
don
t
value
it
oh
you
are
a
good
husband
said
she
carelessly
but
i
want
you
to
take
an
interest
in
your
social
climbing
how
insulting
you
are
she
cried
with
flashing
eyes
i
am
trying
to
claim
the
position
we
are
entitled
to
and
you
speak
of
me
as
if
i
were
one
of
those
vulgar
pushers
i
beg
your
pardon
said
i
humbly
i
was
merely
joking
i
ve
often
told
you
that
your
idea
of
humor
was
revolting
i
felt
distressed
for
her
in
her
chagrin
and
despair
i
was
ready
to
bear
almost
anything
she
might
see
fit
to
inflict
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
i
asked
whatever
it
is
i
ll
do
it
do
you
need
more
money
i
need
help
real
help
said
she
money
s
god
over
the
realm
of
fashion
the
same
as
it
is
over
that
of
of
religion
of
politics
or
anything
you
please
and
luckily
i
ve
got
that
little
god
in
my
employ
my
dear
if
you
are
so
powerful
said
she
put
me
into
fashionable
society
make
these
people
receive
me
and
come
to
my
house
but
they
do
i
reminded
her
i
mean
socially
cried
she
can
t
i
make
you
understand
why
are
business
men
so
dumb
at
anything
else
compel
these
people
to
take
me
as
one
of
them
now
edna
my
dear
protested
i
be
reasonable
how
can
i
do
that
easily
if
you
ve
got
real
power
rejoined
she
it
s
been
done
often
i
ve
found
out
lately
at
least
half
the
leaders
in
society
got
in
originally
by
compelling
it
but
you
going
round
among
men
intimately
you
must
know
it
must
have
known
all
along
if
you
d
been
the
right
sort
of
man
i
d
not
have
to
humiliate
myself
by
asking
you
by
saying
these
dreadful
things
her
eyes
were
flashing
and
her
bosom
was
heaving
women
have
hated
men
for
less
but
i
must
bear
my

well

be
degraded

ll
say
the
things
a
decent
man
would
not

a
woman
to
say
edna

i
pleaded
honestly
i
don
t
understand
you
ll
have
to
tell
me
and
it
s
not
degrading
we
have
no
secrets
from
each
other
we
who
love
each
other
can
say
anything
to
each

do
you
wish
me
to
do
use
your
power
over
the
men
frighten
them
into
ordering
their
wives
to
invite
us
and
to
accept
our
invitations
you
do
business
with
a
lot
of
the
men
don
t
you
yes
said
i
you
can
benefit
or
injure
them
as
you
please
can
t
you
can
take
money
away
from
them
can
put
them
in
the
way
of
making
it
yes
said
i
to
a
certain
extent
and
how
do
you
use
this
power
in
building
up
great
enterprises
i
am
founding
a
city
just
now
for
instance
where
there
was
nothing
but
a
swamp
beside
a
lake
and
in
making
more
and
more
money
for
yourself
she
cut
in
you
think
only
of
yourself
and
you
what
do
you
think
of
said
i
not
of
myself
cried
she
indignantly
never
of
myself
of
margot
of
you
of
the
family
i
am
working
to
build
us
up
to
make
us
somebody
and
not
mere
low
money
grubbers
i
did
not
see
it
from
her
point
of
view
but
i
was
not
inclined
to
aggravate
her
excitement
and
anger
why
shouldn
t
you
use
your
powers
for
some
unselfish
purpose
she
went
on
why
not
try
to
have
higher
ambition
i
observed
her
narrowly
she
was
sincere
i
want
you
to
help
me
for
margot
s
sake
for
your
own
sake
she
went
on
in
a
kind
of
exaltation
margot
is
coming
on
she
ll
be
out
in
less
than
three
years
we
ve
got
to
make
a
position
for
her
i
thought
up
there
at
miss
ryper
s
she
was
that
shows
how
little
interest
you
take
cried
edna
don
t
you
know
what
is
happening
why
already
the
fashionable
girls
at
her
school
are
beginning
to
shy
off
from
her
don
t
be
absurd
laughed
i
that
simply
could
not
be
she
s
lovely
sweet
attractive
in
every
way
any
girls
anywhere
would
be
proud
to
have
her
as
a
friend
how
can
you
be
so
ignorant
of
the
world
cried
edna
in
a
frenzy
of
exasperation
oh
you
ll
drive
me
mad
with
your
stupidity
can
t
you
realize
how
low
fashionable
people
are
the
girls
who
were
her
friends
so
long
as
they
were
all
mere
children
are
now
taking
a
positive
delight
in
snubbing
her
because
she
s
so
pretty
and
will
be
an
heiress
it
gives
them
a
sense
of
power
to
treat
her
as
an
inferior
to
make
her
suffer
i
flung
away
the
cigar
and
sat
up
in
the
chair
how
long
has
this
been
going
on
i
demanded
nearly
a
year
replied
my
wife
it
began
as
soon
as
she
lost
her
childishness
and
developed
toward
a
woman
i
m
glad
i
ve
roused
you
at
last
so
long
as
she
was
a
mere
baby
they
liked
her
invited
her
to
their
children
s
parties
came
to
hers
but
now
they
re
dropping
her
oh
it
s
maddening
they
are
so
sweet
and
smooth
the
vile
little
daughters
of
vile
mothers
incredible
said
i
surely
not
those
sweet
well
mannered
girls
i
ve
seen
here
at
her
parties
they
couldn
t
do
that
sort
of
thing
why
what
do
those
babies
know
about
social
position
and
such
nonsense
what
do
they
know
what
don
t
they
know
cried
edna
trembling
with
rage
at
her
humiliation
and
at
my
incredulity
you
are
an
innocent
there
ought
to
be
a
new
proverb
innocent
as
a
married
man
why
nowadays
the
children
begin
their
social
training
in
the
cradle
they
soon
learn
to
know
a
nurse
or
a
butler
from
a
lady
or
a
gentleman
before
they
learn
to
walk
they
hear
the
servants
talk
they
hear
their
parents
talk
except
innocent
you
everyone
nowadays
thinks
and
talks
about
these
things
but
margot
our
margot
she
doesn
t
know
i
said
with
conviction
edna
laughed
harshly
know
what
kind
of
mother
do
you
think
i
am
of
course
she
knows
haven
t
i
been
teaching
her
ever
since
she
began
to
talk
why
do
you
suppose
i
ve
always
called
her
the
little
duchess
she
suggests
a
superior
little
person
said
i
groping
vaguely
she
suggests
a
superior
person
because
i
gave
her
that
name
and
brought
her
up
to
look
and
act
and
feel
the
part
she
expects
to
be
a
real
duchess
some
day
edna
reared
proudly
and
her
voice
rang
out
confidently
as
she
added
and
she
shall
be
i
stared
at
her
it
seemed
to
me
she
must
be
out
of
her
mind
oh
i
was
indeed
innocent
gentle
reader
i
ve
always
treated
her
as
a
duchess
and
have
made
the
servants
do
it
and
have
trained
her
to
treat
them
as
if
she
were
a
duchess
a
proud
smile
came
into
her
face
transforming
it
suddenly
back
to
its
loveliness
the
first
time
i
ever
read
about
a
duchess
read
knowing
what
i
was
reading
about
i
decided
that
i
would
have
a
daughter
and
that
she
should
be
a
duchess
at
any
previous
time
such
a
sally
would
have
made
me
laugh
but
not
then
for
i
saw
that
she
meant
it
profoundly
and
for
the
first
time
i
was
realizing
what
had
been
going
on
in
my
family
all
unsuspected
by
me
but
first
proceeded
edna
she
shall
have
the
highest
social
position
in
new
york
and
you
must
help
if
i
am
to
succeed
the
fury
burst
into
her
face
again
those
little
wretches
snubbing
her
dropping
her
i
ll
make
them
pay
for
it
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
margot
realizes
all
this
said
i
poor
child
she
s
wretched
about
it
only
yesterday
she
said
to
me
mamma
is
it
true
that
you
and
papa
are
very
common
and
that
we
haven
t
anything
but
a
lot
of
stolen
money
one
of
the
girls
got
mad
at
me
because
i
was
so
good
looking
and
so
proud
and
taunted
me
with
it
incredible
said
i
dazed
she
s
horribly
unhappy
edna
went
on
and
it
cuts
her
to
the
heart
to
be
losing
all
her
dearest
friends
i
did
my
duty
and
taught
her
which
girls
to
cultivate
and
she
was
intimate
only
with
the
right
sort
of
new
york
girls
i
expect
she
has
been
indiscreet
said
i
they
ve
found
out
why
she
made
friends
with
them
and
you
will
drive
me
crazy
cried
edna
can
t
you
understand
all
the
mothers
and
the
governesses
all
the
grown
people
in
respectable
families
teach
the
children
those
mothers
who
don
t
teach
it
directly
see
that
it
s
taught
by
the
governesses
or
else
select
the
proper
friends
for
their
little
girls
and
see
that
they
drop
any
who
aren
t
proper
i
dropped
back
in
my
chair
i
was
stunned
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
never
heard
anything
quite
so
infamous
in
my
life
and
as
i
reflected
on
what
she
had
said
i
wondered
that
i
had
not
realized
it
before
i
recalled
a
hundred
significant
facts
that
had
come
out
in
talks
i
had
had
with
men
women
and
children
in
this
fashionable
world
from
which
we
were
excluded
yet
with
which
we
were
in
constant
and
close
communication
the
question
is
what
are
you
going
to
do
proceeded
edna
i
shook
my
head
probably
looking
as
dazed
as
i
felt
what
does
that
headshake
mean
demanded
she
you
taught
margot
to
be
a
a
like
those
other
girls
said
i
oh
you
fool
cried
edna
and
in
excuse
for
her
please
remember
i
had
ever
been
a
dotingly
bored
slave
of
hers
as
uxorious
a
husband
as
you
ever
saw
and
therefore
inevitably
despised
for
women
have
so
little
intelligence
that
they
despise
a
man
who
loves
them
and
lets
them
rule
you
fool
she
repeated
yes
i
brought
her
up
like
a
lady
taught
her
to
cultivate
nice
things
and
nice
people
what
should
i
teach
her
to
associate
with
common
people
to
drop
back
toward
where
we
came
from
where
you
belong
yes
i
guess
i
do
said
i
up
to
that
time
i
had
interested
myself
in
only
one
aspect
of
human
nature
the
aspect
that
concerned
me
as
a
business
man
but
from
that
time
i
began
to
study
the
human
animal
in
all
his
and
her
aspects
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
learned
what
that
animal
is
forced
to
become
when
exposed
to
the
powerful
thrusts
and
temptings
of
wealth
and
social
position
in
our
alternations
of
pride
and
humility
we
habitually
take
undue
credit
or
give
undue
blame
to
ourselves
for
what
is
wholly
the
result
of
circumstance
the
truth
is
we
are
like
flocks
of
birds
in
a
high
wind
some
of
us
fly
more
steadily
than
others
some
are
quite
beaten
down
others
seem
almost
self
directing
but
all
great
and
small
weak
and
strong
are
controlled
by
the
wind
and
those
who
make
the
best
showing
are
those
who
adapt
themselves
most
skillfully
to
the
will
of
the
wind
at
the
time
when
edna
and
i
were
talking
i
had
not
become
a
philosopher
i
was
in
the
primitive
stages
of
development
in
which
most
men
and
nearly
all
women
remain
their
whole
lives
through
the
stage
in
which
you
live
gentle
reader
with
your
shallow
mistaken
notions
of
what
is
and
your
shallower
mistaken
notions
of
what
ought
to
be
so
as
edna
uncovered
herself
to
me
i
shrank
in
horror
it
was
fortunate
for
her
at
least
that
i
had
always
trained
myself
never
to
make
hasty
speeches
my
expertness
in
that
habit
has
probably
been
the
principal
cause
of
my
business
success
of
my
ability
to
outwit
even
abler
men
than
myself
i
did
not
yield
to
the
impulse
to
burst
out
against
her
i
compressed
my
lips
and
silently
watched
as
she
lifted
the
veil
over
our
family
life
and
revealed
to
me
the
truth
about
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
impatiently
yet
with
a
certain
uneasiness
born
no
doubt
of
a
something
in
my
manner
that
made
her
vaguely
afraid
for
while
she
knew
i
was
her
slave
and
despised
me
as
i
was
to
learn
for
being
so
weak
before
a
mere
woman
she
also
knew
that
outside
of
her
domain
i
was
not
her
slave
nor
anybody
s
but
planned
and
executed
at
the
pleasure
of
my
own
will
i
don
t
know
what
i
m
going
to
do
said
i
slowly
i
must
think
all
this
is
new
to
me
if
you
haven
t
any
pride
in
yourself
or
in
me
said
she
still
you
surely
must
have
pride
for
margot
i
think
so
said
i
if
you
could
know
how
they
have
made
the
poor
child
suffer
i
made
no
reply
nor
did
i
encourage
her
to
talk
further
in
fact
when
she
began
again
i
stopped
her
with
i
ve
heard
enough
my
dear
and
i
ve
some
important
business
to
attend
to
she
preparing
to
leave
me
alone
with
my
papers
came
and
put
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
pressed
her
cheek
against
mine
i
think
she
was
uneasy
about
the
posture
of
the
affair
in
my
mind
feared
stupid
commercial
i
could
not
appreciate
these
vital
things
of
life
i
suspect
my
tranquil
reception
of
her
caresses
did
not
tend
to
allay
her
uneasiness
never
before
had
she
failed
to
interest
me
in
her
physical
self
and
the
only
reason
she
then
failed
was
that
in
the
general
upsetting
of
all
my
ideas
of
what
my
family
life
was
there
had
been
tossed
up
to
the
surface
an
undefined
suspicion
of
her
sincerity
as
a
wife
i
was
not
altogether
blind
as
to
the
relations
of
men
and
women
as
to
the
fact
that
women
often
coolly
played
upon
the
passions
of
men
for
their
own
purposes
of
money
getting
in
its
various
forms
my
wife
was
right
in
her
sneer
at
the
innocence
of
married
men
but
there
are
exceptions
and
a
woman
with
a
husband
intelligent
in
every
way
except
in
seeing
through
women
would
do
well
to
take
care
how
she
tempts
his
intelligence
to
shake
off
its
indifference
in
that
respect
the
next
morning
i
was
breakfasting
alone
as
usual
no
gentle
reader
i
am
not
girding
at
my
poor
wife
as
you
hastily
accuse
i
am
sure
i
do
not
deceive
myself
when
i
say
i
never
was
of
those
men
who
fuss
about
trifles
thank
heaven
as
soon
as
we
had
a
servant
my
wife
kept
away
from
breakfast
it
was
one
of
the
things
i
loved
her
for
if
i
had
been
married
to
a
woman
who
appeared
at
breakfast
looking
lovely
and
smiling
sweetly
i
should
have
become
a
bad
tempered
tyrant
i
want
no
sentimentalities
in
the
early
morning
hours
i
wake
up
uncomfortable
and
sour
and
i
quarrel
with
myself
and
look
about
for
trouble
until
i
have
had
something
to
eat
and
coffee
further
in
the
same
direction
i
took
particular
pleasure
in
my
wife
s
small
personal
slovenlinesses
in
her
curl
papers
in
her
occasional
overlaying
of
her
face
with
cold
cream
and
the
like
in
her
careless
negligee
worn
in
her
own
rooms
there
is
i
guess
no
nature
so
prodigal
that
it
has
not
some
small
economies
edna
had
probably
still
has
a
fondness
for
wearing
out
thoroughly
in
secluded
privacy
house
dresses
underclothes
and
night
gowns
it
took
nothing
from
my
delight
in
her
beauty
that
she
was
not
invariably
beautiful
i
ve
rarely
seen
her
lovely
early
in
the
morning
who
is
i
should
have
taken
habitual
early
morning
loveliness
as
a
personal
insult
i
ve
seen
her
homely
all
day
long
and
for
several
days
at
a
time
she
was
as
attractive
to
me
than
as
at
her
most
beautiful
i
detest
monotony
thank
heaven
she
was
never
monotonous
to
look
at
one
rather
expects
mental
monotony
in
women
unless
one
is
a
fool
i
didn
t
mind
her
times
of
homeliness
because
she
could
be
so
far
far
the
opposite
of
homely
i
did
not
mind
her
way
of
getting
herself
up
in
odds
and
ends
mussily
but
mind
you
never
after
the
passaic
days
unclean
never
i
did
not
mind
her
dishevelments
because
when
she
set
out
to
dress
she
did
it
so
bang
up
well
she
was
born
with
a
talent
for
dress
she
rapidly
developed
it
into
an
art
you
know
what
i
mean
you
ve
seen
the
girl
with
hardly
five
dollars
worth
of
clothing
on
her
including
the
hat
yet
making
the
woman
from
the
best
dressmaker
in
paris
look
a
frump
i
never
had
to
join
the
innumerable
and
pitiful
army
of
men
who
give
the
woman
their
money
to
squander
upon
bad
fits
and
bad
taste
and
are
bowed
down
with
shame
when
they
have
to
issue
forth
with
her
i
can
honestly
say
and
edna
will
bear
me
out
that
i
gave
her
money
freely
no
doubt
the
reason
in
part
was
i
found
it
so
easy
to
make
money
that
i
was
indifferent
to
extravagance
but
the
chief
reason
i
believe
was
edna
s
skill
at
dress
the
woman
who
is
physically
alluring
to
her
husband
and
who
knows
how
to
dress
rarely
has
difficulty
in
getting
money
from
him
though
he
be
a
miser
but
gentle
lady
reader
can
you
in
your
heart
blame
a
man
for
grudging
his
earnings
to
a
woman
who
isn
t
fit
to
dress
and
who
doesn
t
know
how
either
as
i
had
begun
to
tell
when
i
interrupted
myself
i
was
breakfasting
alone
the
morning
after
that
memorable
talk
with
edna
and
margot
came
down
to
glance
in
for
a
smile
at
me
on
her
way
to
school
in
theory
margot
was
still
classed
as
a
child
and
would
be
so
classed
for
two
years
longer
in
fact
she
was
and
had
been
for
two
years
and
more
a
full
fledged
young
lady
that
is
the
way
american
children
of
the
rank
for
which
my
wife
was
training
margot
are
being
brought
up
nowadays
she
had
her
own
apartment
dressing
room
and
bath
sitting
room
reception
room
as
many
rooms
as
my
wife
and
i
had
altogether
when
we
began
married
life
and
about
four
times
the
room
as
for
luxury
a
comparison
would
be
ridiculous
also
margot
had
her
own
staff
of
servants
companion
maid
maid
s
assistant
and
her
own
automobile
with
chauffeur
used
by
no
one
else
it
would
be
hard
to
find
more
helpless
creatures
than
these
young
aspirants
to
aristocracy
and
they
prided
themselves
upon
their
ignorance
of
the
realities
and
their
mothers
often
with
hypocritical
pretense
of
distress
boasted
it
at
that
time
i
thought
it
amusing
the
serious
side
of
it
was
entirely
out
of
my
range
we
american
men
of
the
comfortable
and
luxurious
classes
are
addicted
to
the
habit
of
regarding
our
wives
and
children
as
toys
as
mere
sources
of
amusement
not
to
be
taken
seriously
it
isn
t
strange
that
the
children
should
not
mind
this
but
what
a
commentary
upon
the
real
mentality
of
the
women
that
they
tolerate
and
encourage
it
our
women
are
always
with
a
fine
show
of
earnestness
demanding
that
they
be
taken
seriously
but
woe
unto
the
man
who
believes
them
in
earnest
and
tries
to
treat
them
as
his
equals
instead
of
as
dainty
toys
odalisques
how
he
will
be
denounced
hated
and
if
proper
alimony
can
be
got
divorced
margot
s
parties
differed
in
no
respect
from
grown
up
parties
except
that
there
were
restrictions
in
the
matter
of
hours
and
also
as
to
the
serving
of
drinks
for
i
believe
my
wife
did
not
follow
the
extreme
of
fashionable
custom
but
forbade
wines
and
punch
at
these
parties
in
this
matter
as
in
the
matter
of
using
slang
and
in
many
others
she
held
that
only
people
of
long
established
social
position
people
with
what
is
called
tradition
could
safely
make
excursions
beyond
the
bounds
of
conventionality
that
it
was
safest
wisest
for
people
like
herself
to
stay
well
within
the
bounds
to
be
prim
even
and
so
to
avoid
any
possible
criticism
as
vulgar
a
very
shrewd
woman
was
edna
if
her
intelligence
had
been
equal
to
her
shrewdness
and
energy
and
if
she
had
possessed
a
gleam
of
the
sense
of
humor
however
in
no
essential
respect
did
margot
s
routine
of
life
differ
from
that
of
her
mother
and
her
mother
s
routine
of
inane
and
worthless
time
killing
was
modeled
exactly
upon
that
of
all
the
fashionable
women
and
apers
of
fashionable
women
edna
did
a
vast
amount
of
studying
with
and
without
teachers
it
was
all
shallow
and
showy
margot
s
studies
were
also
beneath
contempt
i
amused
myself
from
time
to
time
by
inquiring
with
pretense
of
gravity
into
what
they
were
teaching
her
at
the
ryper
school
for
the
turning
out
of
fashionable
womanhood
such
a
mess
of
trash
she
was
learning
much
about
social
usages
from
how
to
sit
in
a
carriage
a
rare
art
that
i
assure
you
gentle
reader
to
how
to
receive
guests
at
a
large
dinner
she
was
studying
some
of
the
vulgarities
science
history
literature
and
the
like
but
in
no
vulgar
way
she
would
get
only
the
thinnest
smatter
of
talkable
stuff
about
them
nothing
unsettling
nothing
that
might
possibly
rouse
the
mind
to
think
or
distract
the
attention
from
the
high
things
of
life
she
was
dabbling
in
music
in
drawing
in
several
similar
costly
fripperies
and
the
sum
total
of
expense
well
no
wonder
miss
ryper
was
fast
becoming
as
rich
as
some
of
the
asteroids
in
the
plutocracy
she
adored
i
regarded
margot
s
education
as
a
species
of
joke
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
our
pretty
baby
had
the
right
to
be
educated
to
become
a
wife
and
a
mother
and
why
should
it
have
occurred
to
me
where
is
that
being
done
who
is
thinking
of
it
in
all
the
oceans
of
twaddle
about
the
elevation
of
woman
where
is
there
a
drop
of
good
sense
about
real
education
you
say
i
was
criminally
negligent
as
to
my
daughter
s
education
but
how
about
your
own
the
truth
is
we
all
still
look
upon
education
as
a
frill
an
ornament
we
never
think
of
it
whether
for
our
sons
or
for
our
daughters
as
nothing
more
or
less
than
teaching
a
human
being
how
to
live
it
is
high
time
to
end
this
idiotic
ignorant
exaltation
of
tomfoolery
into
culture
poor
margot
how
the
little
girls
in
plain
clothes
and
machine
made
underwear
must
have
envied
her
as
she
swept
along
in
her
limousine
dressed
with
that
enormously
costly
simplicity
which
only
the
rich
can
afford
no
wonder
many
of
the
other
girls
at
the
ryper
school
hated
her
for
her
mother
was
in
one
respect
unlike
most
of
the
fashionable
mothers
who
are
too
busy
doing
things
not
worth
doing
to
attend
to
their
children
her
mother
gave
her
loving
care
spent
many
hours
of
anxious
thought
no
doubt
in
planning
to
make
her
the
most
luxurious
the
most
helpless
the
most
envied
girl
in
the
school
we
hear
unendingly
about
the
good
that
love
does
in
the
world
not
too
much
no
indeed
but
at
the
same
time
might
it
not
be
well
if
we
also
heard
about
the
harm
love
can
do
and
does
how
many
sons
and
daughters
have
been
ruined
by
loving
parents
how
many
husbands
have
been
wrecked
by
the
flatteries
and
the
assiduities
of
loving
wives
how
many
wives
have
been
lured
to
decay
and
destruction
by
the
over
indulgent
love
of
their
husbands
what
we
need
in
this
world
is
not
more
sentiment
but
more
intelligence
sentiment
is
a
force
that
rushes
far
and
crazily
in
both
directions
gentle
reader
unless
it
has
well
balanced
intelligence
to
guide
it
margot
smiling
in
the
doorway
of
the
breakfast
room
put
me
at
once
into
a
less
somber
humor
she
was
tall
and
slim
an
inch
taller
than
her
mother
and
with
the
same
supple
well
proportioned
figure
she
had
her
mother
s
small
tip
tilted
face
and
luminous
eyes
but
they
were
of
an
intense
dark
gray
that
gave
her
an
expression
of
poetic
thoughtfulness
and
mystery
whiter
or
more
perfectly
formed
teeth
i
have
never
seen
in
former
days
children
s
teeth
were
neglected
but
my
wife
with
her
peculiar
reach
for
all
matters
having
to
do
with
appearances
had
learned
the
modern
methods
of
caring
for
the
body
when
margot
was
still
in
the
period
when
the
body
is
almost
as
formable
as
sculptor
s
clay
thus
margot
s
teeth
had
been
looked
after
and
made
perfect
and
kept
so
her
hair
hung
loose
upon
her
shoulders
like
a
wonderful
changeable
veil
of
golden
brown
often
at
first
glance
you
are
dazzled
by
these
carefully
fed
and
carefully
groomed
children
of
the
rich
only
to
note
at
the
second
glance
that
the
best
showing
has
been
made
of
precious
little
in
the
way
of
natural
charm
but
this
was
not
true
of
margot
the
longer
you
looked
and
the
more
attentively
the
finer
she
seemed
to
be
like
a
rare
perfect
specimen
from
a
connoisseur
s
greenhouses
there
s
no
doubt
about
it
edna
did
know
the
physical
side
of
life
she
would
have
got
notable
results
even
had
we
been
poor
as
it
was
with
all
the
money
she
cared
to
spend
she
performed
what
looked
like
miracles
come
and
kiss
me
margot
said
i
she
obeyed
with
a
charming
air
of
restrained
eagerness
that
is
regarded
as
ladylike
my
car
is
waiting
said
she
i
m
late

that
therese
her

out
in
the
hall

yes
miss
parnell
her
companion
has
a
headache
poor
creature
margot
had
caught
to
perfection
the
refined
elegant
fashionable
tone
of
speaking
of
the
servile
classes
though
i
was
in
a
critical
mood
that
morning
i
was
not
critical
of
my
beloved
little
margot
and
her
airs
entertained
me
as
much
as
ever
said
i
sit
down
little
duchess
the
familiar
name
slipped
out
unconsciously
and
talk
to
me
a
few
minutes
but
i
m
shockingly
late
papa
pleaded
she
no
matter
i
ll
telephone
miss
ryper
if
you
wish
to
the
butler
who
was
serving
me
sackville
go
tell
therese
that
i
m
detaining
miss
margot
and
close
the
door
behind
you
sackville
retired
margot
seated
herself
with
alacrity
she
did
not
like
her
useless
school
any
better
than
other
children
like
more
or
less
useful
schools
are
you
taking
me
to
the
theater
saturday
afternoon
as
you
promised
said
she
and
do
get
a
box
and
let
me
ask
two
of
the
girls
certainly
said
i
if
i
can
t
go
miss
parnell
will
chaperon
you
no
i
want
you
papa
it
s
so
nice
to
have
a
man
how
are
you
getting
on
at
school
not
with
the
studies
i
laughed
at
the
absurdity
of
calling
her
fiddle
faddle
studies
but
with
the
girls
her
face
clouded
has
mamma
told
you
told
me
what
she
hesitated
go
on
dear
said
i
what
s
the
trouble
oh
it
s
always
the
same
thing
she
sighed
with
a
grown
up
air
that
was
both
humorous
and
pathetic
some
of
the
girls
are
down
on
me
about
about
social
position
you
see
we
don
t
go
socially
with
their
families
why
should
we
said
i
we
don
t
know
them
nor
they
us
naturally
they
don
t
care
anything
about
us
nor
we
about
them
she
hung
her
head
but
i
want
to
go
with
them
said
she
doggedly
why
said
i
because
because
it
s
the
proper
thing
to
do
if
you
don
t
go
with
them
everybody
looks
down
on
you
she
lifted
her
head
and
her
flashing
eyes
reminded
me
of
her
mother
it
makes
me
just
wild
to
be
looked
down
on
i
should
say
so
said
i
those
little
girls
at
miss
ryper
s
must
be
an
ill
bred
lot
we
must
take
you
away
from
there
and
put
you
in
a
school
with
nice
girls
oh
no
father
she
cried
in
a
panic
those
girls
are
the
nicest
the
only
nice
girls
in
any
school
in
new
york
all
the
other
schools
look
up
to
ours
i
d
cry
my
eyes
out
in
any
other
school
why
said
i
i
d
feel
low
her
eyes
had
filled
and
her
cheeks
were
flushed
i
d
be
out
of
place
except
among
the
richest
and
most
aristocratic
girls
but
you
don
t
like
them
said
i
gently
i
began
to
feel
a
sensation
of
sickness
at
the
heart
i
hate
them
cried
she
with
passionate
energy
but
i
want
to
stay
on
there
and
make
them
be
friendly
with
me
i
ve
got
too
much
pride
papa
to
run
away
pride
said
i
and
my
tone
must
have
been
sad
that
isn
t
pride
dear
you
ought
to
choose
your
friends
by
liking
you
ought
to
feel
above
girls
with
such
cheap
ideas
but
i
m
not
above
them
protested
she
and
i
couldn
t
like
any
girl
i
d
be
ashamed
to
be
seen
with
unless
she
were
a
sort
of
servant
oh
papa
you
don
t
appreciate
how
proud
i
am
proud
of
what
dear
of
your
parents
of
yourself
she
hung
her
head
of
what
dear
i
urged
it
hurts
me
not
to
be
treated
as
as
the
inside
clique
of
girls
in
our
secret
society
treat
each
other
she
was
almost
crying
they
don
t
even
call
me
by
my
first
name
any
more
they
speak
to
me
as
miss
loring
and
so
politely
exactly
as
i
speak
to
miss
parnell
or
one
of
the
teachers
or
a
servant
oh
i
m
so
proud
i
d
love
to
be
like
gracie
fortescue
she
speaks
even
to
miss
ryper
as
i
would
to
miss
parnell
my
digestion
wasn
t
any
too
good
even
in
those
days
my
whole
breakfast
suddenly
went
wrong
turned
to
poison
inside
me
i
suppose
a
hot
wave
of
rage
against
i
knew
not
whom
or
what
rolled
up
into
my
brain
i
pushed
away
my
plate
abruptly
run
along
child
i
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
i
did
not
recognize
as
my
own
she
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
with
a
gesture
and
an
expression
that
made
me
realize
how
close
a
copy
of
her
mother
she
was
you
wouldn
t
take
me
away
from
my
school
would
you
papa
dear
she
pleaded
all
i
want
is
to
make
you
happy
said
i
patting
and
stroking
that
thick
and
lovely
veil
of
flowing
hair
she
assumed
that
i
meant
she
was
to
stay
on
with
the
viperous
ryper
brood
and
went
away
almost
happy
she
had
awakened
to
the
fact
that
there
were
fates
even
worse
than
being
snubbed
and
addressed
like
a
teacher
or
a
companion
or
a
servant
or
some
other
lower
animal
yes
far
worse
fates
for
instance
not
being
able
to
feel
that
she
was
on
whatever
degrading
terms
at
least
associated
with
the
adored
fashionables
that
evening
when
my
wife
again
accompanied
me
to
my
study
after
dinner
i
said
to
her
i
ve
been
turning
over
our
talk
last
night
i
haven
t
been
able
to
reach
a
conclusion
as
yet
except
on
one
point
i
can
t
help
you
socially
in
the
way
you
suggested
i
glanced
at
her
as
i
said
this
she
was
looking
at
me
her
pale
intense
expression
fascinated
me
i
don
t
think
you
have
thought
about
it
fully
said
she
slowly
yes
said
i
with
my
utmost
deliberateness
and
my
decision
is
final
she
rose
stood
beside
her
chair
rubbing
her
hand
softly
along
the
top
of
the
back
very
well
said
she
quietly
and
she
left
me
alone
v
in
refusing
edna
her
heart
s
desire
thus
promptly
and
tersely
i
had
an
object
i
assumed
she
would
protest
and
argue
in
the
discussion
that
would
follow
some
light
might
come
to
me
utterly
befogged
as
to
what
course
to
take
about
my
family
affairs
i
knew
something
should
be
done
something
quick
and
drastic
but
what
it
was
no
new
experience
to
me
to
be
faced
with
complex
and
well
nigh
impossible
situations
my
business
life
had
been
a
succession
of
such
experiences
and
while
i
had
learned
much
as
to
handling
them
i
had
also
learned
how
dangerous
it
is
to
rush
in
recklessly
and
to
begin
action
before
one
has
discovered
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
the
world
is
full
of
hasty
hals
and
hatties
who
pride
themselves
on
their
emergency
minds
on
knowing
just
what
to
do
in
any
situation
the
instant
it
arises
and
fine
spectacles
they
are
lying
buried
and
broken
amid
the
ruins
they
have
aggravated
if
not
created
how
recover
my
wife
how
rescue
my
daughter
i
could
think
of
no
plan
of
no
beginning
toward
a
plan
and
when
edna
by
receiving
my
refusal
in
cold
silence
defeated
my
hope
of
a
possibly
illuminating
discussion
i
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
why
had
i
refused
to
help
her
in
the
way
she
suggested
not
on
moral
grounds
gentle
reader
there
i
should
have
been
as
free
from
scruple
as
you
yourself
would
have
been
as
you
perhaps
have
been
in
your
social
climbing
or
maneuvering
in
your
native
town
wherever
it
is
nor
yet
through
fear
of
failure
i
did
not
know
the
social
game
but
i
did
know
something
of
human
nature
and
i
had
found
out
that
the
triumphant
class
far
from
being
the
gentlest
and
most
civilized
as
its
dominant
position
in
civilization
would
indicate
was
in
fact
the
most
barbarous
was
saturated
with
the
raw
savage
spirit
of
the
right
of
might
i
am
speaking
of
actualities
not
of
pretenses
of
deeds
not
of
words
to
find
a
class
approaching
it
in
frank
savagery
of
will
and
action
you
would
have
to
descend
through
the
social
strata
until
you
came
to
the
class
that
wields
the
blackjack
and
picks
pockets
and
dynamites
safes
the
triumphant
class
became
triumphant
not
by
refinement
and
courtesy
and
consideration
but
by
defiance
of
those
fundamentals
of
civilization
by
successful
defiance
of
them
it
remained
the
triumphant
class
by
keeping
that
primal
savagery
of
nature
as
soon
as
any
member
of
it
began
to
grow
tame
gentle
considerate
except
where
consideration
for
others
would
increase
his
own
wealth
and
power
became
really
a
disciple
of
the
sweet
gospel
he
professed
and
urged
upon
others
just
so
soon
did
he
begin
to
lose
his
wealth
into
the
strong
unscrupulous
hands
ever
reaching
for
it
and
with
waning
wealth
naturally
power
and
prestige
waned
no
i
did
not
refuse
because
i
thought
the
triumphant
class
would
contemptuously
repel
any
attempt
to
carry
its
social
doors
by
assault
i
saw
plainly
enough
that
i
could
compel
enough
of
these
society
leaders
to
receive
my
wife
and
daughters
to
insure
their
position
you
have
seen
swine
gathered
about
a
trough
comfortably
swilling
you
have
seen
a
huge
porker
come
running
with
angry
squeal
to
join
the
banquet
you
have
observed
how
rudely
how
fiercely
he
is
resented
and
fought
off
by
the
others
this
until
he
by
biting
and
thrusting
has
made
a
place
for
himself
then
the
fact
that
he
is
an
intruder
and
the
method
of
his
getting
a
place
are
forgotten
and
the
swilling
goes
peacefully
forward
so
it
is
gentle
reader
though
it
horrifies
your
hypocrisy
to
be
told
it
so
do
human
beings
conduct
themselves
round
a
financial
or
political
or
social
swill
trough
i
should
have
had
small
difficulty
in
biting
and
kicking
a
satisfactory
place
for
edna
and
margot
at
the
social
swill
trough
i
should
have
had
no
difficulty
at
all
in
keeping
it
for
them
but
you
will
be
incredulous
gentle
reader
devoured
of
snobbishness
and
dazzled
by
what
you
have
heard
and
read
of
the
glories
of
fashionable
society
in
the
metropolis
you
will
be
incredulous
because
you
too
like
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
comfortable
classes
in
this
great
democracy
and
many
of
the
not
so
comfortable
classes
as
well
because
you
too
are
infected
of
the
mania
for
looking
about
for
some
one
who
refuses
to
associate
with
you
on
the
ground
that
you
are
common
and
for
straightway
making
it
your
heart
s
dearest
desire
to
compel
that
person
to
associate
with
you
you
will
be
incredulous
when
i
tell
you
my
sole
reason
was
my
hatred
and
horror
of
what
seemed
to
me
the
degrading
vulgar
and
rotten
longings
that
filled
my
wife
and
that
had
infected
my
daughter
that
hatred
and
horror
had
thrown
me
into
a
state
of
mind
i
did
not
dare
confess
to
myself
you
are
incredulous
but
perhaps
you
will
admit
i
may
be
truthful
when
i
explain
that
the
reason
for
my
moral
and
sentimental
revolt
was
perhaps
in
large
part
my
dense
ignorance
of
the
whole
society
side
of
life
no
doubt
in
the
passaic
public
school
of
my
boyhood
there
had
been
as
much
snobbishness
as
there
is
in
fifth
avenue
but
i
had
somehow
never
happened
to
notice
it
it
must
have
been
there
it
must
be
elemental
in
human
nature
how
else
account
for
my
wife
we
hear
more
about
the
snobbishness
of
fifth
avenue
than
we
do
about
the
snobbishness
of
the
tenements
but
that
is
solely
because
fifth
avenue
is
more
conspicuous
also
fifth
avenue
supposedly
educated
supposedly
broadened
by
knowledge
and
taste
has
no
excuse
for
petty
vanities
that
belong
only
to
the
ignorant
and
if
fifth
avenue
were
really
educated
really
had
knowledge
and
taste
it
could
not
be
snobbish
however
my
busy
life
had
never
been
touched
by
social
snobbishness
i
preferred
to
know
and
to
associate
with
men
better
educated
and
richer
than
i
but
for
excellent
practical
reasons
because
from
such
men
i
could
get
the
knowledge
and
the
wealth
i
needed
but
i
would
not
have
wasted
a
moment
of
my
precious
time
upon
the
men
most
exalted
in
fashionable
life
the
ignorant
incompetents
who
had
inherited
their
wealth
they
seemed
ridiculous
and
worthless
to
me
a
man
of
thought
and
action
so
the
sudden
exposure
of
my
wife
s
and
my
little
girl
s
disease
gave
me
a
shock
hardly
to
be
measured
by
the
man
or
woman
used
all
his
life
to
the
social
craze
it
was
much
as
if
i
had
suddenly
seen
upon
their
bared
bosoms
the
disgusting
ravages
of
cancer
as
i
could
not
devise
any
line
of
action
that
however
faintly
promised
results
i
kept
away
from
home
i
absorbed
myself
in
some
new
enterprises
that
filled
my
evenings
which
i
spent
at
my
club
with
the
men
i
drew
into
them
at
the
mention
of
club
gentle
reader
i
see
your
ears
pricking
you
are
wondering
what
sort
of
club
i
belonged
to
i
shall
explain
it
was
the
amsterdam
club
you
may
have
seen
and
gawked
at
its
vast
and
imposing
red
sandstone
front
in
middle
fifth
avenue
as
you
drove
by
in
the
rubber
neck
wagon
the
man
with
the
megaphone
may
have
shouted
the
amsterdam
club
otherwise
known
as
the
palace
of
plutocracy
the
total
wealth
of
its
members
is
one
tenth
of
the
total
wealth
of
the
united
states
every
great
millionaire
in
new
york
city
belongs
to
it
the
reason
you
see
no
one
in
the
magnificent
windows
is
because
the
plutocrats
are
afraid
of
cranks
with
pistol
or
bomb
and
you
stared
and
envied
and
craned
your
neck
backward
as
the
sight
seeing
car
rolled
on
a
fairly
accurate
description
of
my
club
but
you
will
calm
as
i
go
on
to
tell
you
the
inside
truth
about
it
it
was
built
to
provide
a
club
for
those
rich
men
of
new
york
who
had
no
social
position
and
so
could
not
be
admitted
to
the
fashionable
clubs
it
was
not
built
by
those
outcasts
for
whom
it
was
intended
but
by
the
rich
men
of
the
fashionable
world
they
did
not
build
it
out
of
pity
nor
yet
out
of
generosity
but
for
freedom
and
convenience
you
must
know
that
the
rich
both
the
fashionables
and
the
excludeds
are
intimately
associated
in
business
now
in
the
days
before
the
amsterdam
club
if
a
rich
fashionable
wished
to
talk
business
out
of
office
hours
with
a
rich
unfashionable
he
had
to
take
him
to
his
home
or
to
his
club
one
or
the
other
you
will
readily
appreciate
that
either
course
involved
disagreeable
complications
the
rich
unfashionable
would
say
why
am
i
not
invited
to
this
snob
s
house
socially
why
does
not
this
hound
see
that
i
am
elected
to
his
elegant
club
i
ll
teach
this
wrinkle
snout
how
to
spit
at
me
i
ll
slip
a
stiletto
into
his
back
damn
him
as
the
number
of
rich
unfashionables
increased
as
the
number
of
stealthy
financial
stilettoings
for
social
insult
grew
and
swelled
the
demand
for
a
way
out
became
more
clamorous
and
panicky
the
final
result
was
the
amsterdam
club
perhaps
by
inspiration
perhaps
by
accident
and
so
it
has
come
to
pass
that
now
when
a
rich
fashionable
wishes
to
talk
finance
with
a
rich
pariah
he
does
not
have
to
run
the
risk
of
defiling
his
home
or
his
exclusive
club
with
the
gracious
cordiality
wherefor
aristocracy
is
famed
in
song
and
story
he
says
let
us
go
to
our
club
for
the
rich
fashionables
see
to
it
that
every
rich
pariah
is
elected
to
the
amsterdam
immediately
he
becomes
a
person
of
financial
consequence
and
i
fancy
that
not
one
in
ten
of
the
rich
pariah
members
dreams
how
he
is
being
insulted
and
tricked
all
or
nearly
all
imagine
they
are
elected
by
favor
of
the
great
fashionable
plutocrats
to
about
the
most
exclusive
club
in
new
york
also
not
one
in
a
dozen
of
the
fashionable
members
appreciates
how
he
is
degrading
himself
for
to
my
quaint
mind
the
snob
degrades
only
himself
well
not
many
months
after
we
moved
from
brooklyn
to
manhattan
i
was
elected
to
the
amsterdam
i
in
serene
ignorance
of
the
trick
that
was
being
played
upon
me
by
my
sponsors
associates
in
large
financial
deals
and
members
of
several
exclusive
really
fashionable
clubs
they
pulled
regretful
faces
as
they
talked
of
the
long
waiting
lists
at
most
of
the
clubs
they
brightened
as
they
spoke
of
the
amsterdam
the
finest
and
take
it
all
round
the
most
satisfactory
of
the
whole
bunch
old
man
and
we
believe
we
ve
got
pull
enough
to
put
you
in
there
pretty
soon
we
ll
work
it
somehow
if
i
had
known
the
shrivel
hearted
trick
behind
their
genial
friendliness
i
should
not
have
minded
should
probably
have
laughed
for
human
littlenesses
do
not
irritate
me
and
i
have
a
vanity
i
prefer
to
call
it
a
pride
that
lifts
me
out
of
their
reach
i
am
of
the
one
aristocracy
that
is
truly
exclusive
the
only
one
that
needs
no
artificial
barriers
to
keep
it
so
but
i
shall
not
bore
you
gentle
reader
by
explaining
about
it
you
are
interested
only
in
the
aristocracies
of
rank
and
title
and
wealth
that
are
nothing
but
the
tawdry
realization
of
the
tawdry
fancies
of
the
yokel
among
his
kine
and
the
scullery
maid
among
her
pots
for
who
but
a
tossed
up
yokel
or
scullery
maid
would
indulge
in
such
vulgarities
as
sitting
upon
a
gold
throne
or
living
in
a
draughty
cheerless
palace
or
seeking
to
make
himself
more
ridiculous
by
aggravating
his
littleness
with
a
title
like
the
ass
in
the
lion
s
skin
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
gentle
reader
that
aristocracy
is
essentially
common
essentially
vulgar
to
a
large
vision
the
distinction
between
king
and
carpenter
between
the
man
with
a
million
dollars
and
the
million
men
with
one
dollar
looks
trivial
and
unimportant
only
a
squat
and
squinting
soul
in
a
cellar
and
blinking
through
the
twilight
could
discover
agitating
differences
of
rank
between
fifth
avenue
and
grand
street
between
first
floor
front
and
attic
rear
between
flesh
ripening
to
rot
in
silk
and
flesh
ripening
to
rot
in
cotton
to
an
infinitesimal
insect
an
infinite
gulf
yawns
between
the
molecules
of
a
razor
s
edge
i
often
found
my
club
a
convenience
for
in
those
busiest
days
of
my
financial
career
i
had
much
private
conferring
or
conspiring
if
you
choose
never
had
i
found
it
so
convenient
as
when
for
the
first
time
there
was
pain
and
shrinking
at
the
thought
of
going
home
of
seeing
my
wife
and
margot
my
margot
when
she
was
a
baby
how
proudly
i
had
wheeled
her
along
the
sidewalks
of
passaic
in
the
showy
perambulator
we
bought
for
her
and
the
twenty
five
dollars
it
cost
loomed
mighty
big
even
to
edna
and
in
brooklyn
what
happy
sundays
edna
and
i
had
had
with
her
when
i
would
hire
a
buggy
at
the
livery
stable
round
the
corner
and
we
would
go
out
for
the
day
to
some
long
island
woods
or
when
we
would
take
her
down
to
the
respectable
end
of
coney
island
to
dig
in
the
sand
and
to
wade
after
the
receding
tide
my
margot
no
longer
mine
never
again
to
be
mine
one
evening
i
had
an
appointment
at
the
amsterdam
with
a
western
millionaire
charles
murdock
whom
i
had
interested
in
a
canada
railway
to
tap
a
hudson
bay
spruce
forest
he
was
having
trouble
with
his
wife
and
something
of
it
had
come
out
in
the
afternoon
newspapers
at
the
last
moment
his
secretary
who
by
the
way
afterwards
married
the
divorced
mrs
murdock
telephoned
that
murdock
could
not
keep
his
engagement
to
dine
i
looked
about
for
some
one
to
help
me
eat
the
dinner
i
had
ordered
there
are
never
many
disengaged
men
in
the
amsterdam
the
fashionable
rich
come
only
when
they
have
business
with
the
pariahs
the
pariahs
prefer
their
own
houses
or
the
barrooms
and
caf
s
of
the
big
hotels
i
therefore
thought
myself
lucky
when
i
found
bob
armitage
sulking
in
a
huge
leather
chair
and
got
him
to
share
my
dinner
armitage
was
one
of
my
railway
directors
he
had
helped
me
carry
through
the
big
stroke
that
made
me
had
joined
in
half
a
dozen
of
my
enterprises
in
all
of
which
i
had
been
successful
there
was
no
man
of
my
acquaintance
i
knew
and
liked
so
well
as
armitage
yet
it
had
so
happened
that
we
had
never
talked
much
with
each
other
except
about
business
it
promised
to
be
a
silent
dinner
he
was
as
deep
in
his
thoughts
as
i
was
in
mine
and
our
faces
showed
that
neither
of
us
was
cogitating
anything
cheerful
on
impulse
i
suddenly
said
bob
do
you
know
about
fashionable
new
york
society
i
knew
that
he
did
that
is
to
say
i
had
often
heard
he
was
one
of
the
heavy
swells
having
all
three
titles
to
fashion
wealth
birth
and
marriage
but
i
now
pretended
ignorance
of
the
fact
when
you
wish
to
inform
yourself
thoroughly
on
a
subject
you
should
always
select
an
expert
tell
him
you
know
nothing
and
bid
him
enlighten
you
from
the
alphabet
up
why
do
you
ask
said
armitage
do
you
want
to
get
in
i
had
a
notion
you
didn
t
care
for
society
you
and
your
wife
armitage
didn
t
go
to
holy
cross
but
to
st
bartholomew
s
so
he
had
never
known
of
my
wife
s
activities
knew
only
the
sort
of
man
i
was
oh
i
forgot
he
went
on
you
ve
a
daughter
almost
grown
i
suppose
you
want
her
looked
after
all
right
i
ll
attend
to
it
for
you
your
wife
won
t
mind
my
wife
s
calling
i
d
have
sent
her
long
ago
in
fact
i
apologize
for
not
having
done
it
but
i
hate
the
fashionable
crowd
they
bore
me
however
your
wife
may
like
them
women
usually
do
it
was
at
my
lips
to
thank
him
and
decline
his
offer
then
it
flashed
into
my
mind
that
perhaps
my
one
hope
of
getting
back
my
wife
and
daughter
of
restoring
them
to
sanity
lay
in
letting
them
have
what
they
wanted
another
sort
of
man
might
have
deluded
himself
with
the
notion
that
he
could
set
his
foot
down
stamp
out
revolt
compel
his
family
to
do
as
he
willed
but
i
happen
not
to
be
of
that
instinctively
tyrannical
and
therefore
inherently
stupid
temperament
armitage
ate
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
then
said
i
ll
have
you
elected
to
the
federal
club
this
club
is
all
i
need
said
i
he
smiled
sardonically
i
didn
t
understand
that
smile
then
because
i
didn
t
know
anything
about
caste
in
new
york
you
let
me
look
after
you
said
he
you
re
a
child
in
the
social
game
i
ve
no
objection
to
remaining
so
said
i
quite
right
there
s
nothing
in
it
said
he
but
you
must
remember
you
re
living
in
a
world
of
rather
cheap
fools
and
they
are
impressed
by
that
nothing
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
the
social
prizes
have
a
large
substantial
value
over
here
the
value
s
small
still
it
s
something
you
wouldn
t
refuse
even
a
trading
stamp
would
you
i
laughed
i
refuse
nothing
said
i
i
take
whatever
s
offered
me
if
i
find
i
don
t
want
it
why
what
s
easier
than
to
throw
it
away
then
i
ll
put
you
in
the
federal
club
you
could
have
made
me
do
it
if
you
had
happened
to
want
it
so
why
shouldn
t
i
do
it
anyhow
in
appreciation
of
your
forbearance
you
don
t
realize
but
i
m
doing
for
you
what
about
two
thirds
of
the
members
of
this
club
would
lick
my
boots
to
get
me
to
do
for
them
i
had
no
idea
the
taste
for
shoe
polish
was
so
general
here
said
i
it
s
a
human
taste
my
dear
loring
replied
he
it
s
as
common
as
the
taste
for
bread
all
the
men
have
it
as
for
the
women
they
like
nothing
so
well
having
one
s
boots
licked
is
the
highest
human
joy
next
comes
licking
boots
you
don
t
believe
that
said
i
for
his
tone
was
almost
too
bitter
for
jest
you
aren
t
acquainted
with
your
kind
old
man
retorted
he
i
don
t
know
the
kind
you
know
said
i
and
then
i
remembered
my
wife
and
my
daughter
there
must
be
truth
in
what
armitage
had
said
for
my
beautiful
wife
and
my
sweet
daughter
both
looking
so
proud
surely
they
could
not
be
rare
exceptions
in
their
insensibility
to
what
seemed
to
me
elemental
self
respect
you
don
t
know
your
kind
he
went
on
because
you
don
t
indulge
in
cringing
and
don
t
encourage
it
you
re
like
the
cold
pure
minded
woman
who
goes
through
the
world
imagining
it
a
chaste
and
austere
place
because
her
very
face
silences
and
awes
sensuality
you
are
part
of
the
small
advance
guard
of
a
race
that
is
to
come
he
grinned
satirically
perhaps
you
ll
drop
out
in
the
next
few
months
we
ll
see
when
the
silence
was
again
broken
it
was
broken
by
me
do
you
know
a
school
kept
by
a
woman
named
ryper
i
inquired
sure
i
do
replied
he
he
gave
me
a
shrewd
laughing
glance
the
daughter
isn
t
learning
anything
nothing
but
mischief
said
i
that
s
what
ryper
s
for
but
what
does
it
matter
why
should
a
woman
learn
anything
they
re
of
no
consequence
the
less
a
man
has
to
do
with
them
the
better
off
he
will
be
they
re
of
the
highest
consequence
said
i
bitterly
they
have
the
control
of
the
coming
generation
and
a
hell
of
a
generation
it
s
to
be
cried
he
suddenly
rousing
from
the
state
of
bored
apathy
in
which
he
seemed
to
pass
most
of
his
time
you
ve
got
me
started
on
the
subject
that
s
a
craze
with
me
i
have
only
one
strong
feeling
and
that
is
my
contempt
for
woman
the
american
woman
i
m
not
speaking
about
the
masses
they
don
t
count
they
never
did
they
never
will
no
one
counts
until
he
gets
some
education
and
some
property
i
suppose
the
women
of
the
masses
do
as
well
as
could
be
expected
but
how
about
the
women
of
the
classes
with
education
and
property
do
you
know
why
the
world
advances
so
slowly
why
the
upper
classes
are
always
tumbling
back
and
everything
has
to
be
begun
all
over
again
i
ve
a
suspicion
said
i
because
the
men
are
fools
about
the
women
the
sex
question
cried
armitage
that
s
the
only
question
worth
agitating
about
until
it
s
settled
or
begins
to
be
settled
and
settled
right
it
s
useless
to
attempt
anything
else
the
men
climb
up
the
women
they
take
on
their
backs
become
a
heavier
and
heavier
burden
and
down
they
both
drop
and
the
children
with
them
selfish
vain
extravagant
mothers
crazy
about
snobbishness
bringing
up
their
children
in
extravagance
ignorance
and
snobbishness
that
s
america
to
day
the
men
are
fools
about
the
women
and
they
let
the
women
make
fools
of
themselves
the
men
are
fools
but
not
about
the
women
said
armitage
how
much
time
and
thought
for
your
family
have
you
averaged
daily
in
the
last
ten
years
i
ve
been
busy
said
i
i
ve
had
to
look
out
for
the
bread
and
butter
you
know
exactly
exclaimed
he
in
triumph
you
think
you
re
fond
of
your
family
no
doubt
you
are
but
the
bottom
truth
is
you
re
indifferent
to
your
family
i
can
prove
it
in
a
sentence
you
attend
to
anything
you
care
about
and
you
haven
t
attended
to
them
i
stared
at
him
like
a
man
dazzled
by
a
sudden
light
which
in
fact
i
was
guilty
or
not
guilty
said
he
laughing
guilty
said
i
the
american
man
too
busy
to
be
bothered
turns
the
american
woman
loose
gives
her
absolute
freedom
and
what
is
she
a
child
in
education
a
child
in
experience
a
child
in
taste
he
turns
her
loose
bids
her
do
as
she
likes
and
up
to
the
limit
of
his
ability
gives
her
all
the
money
she
wants
he
prefers
her
a
child
her
childishness
rests
his
tired
brain
and
he
doesn
t
mind
if
she
s
a
little
mischievous
that
makes
her
more
amusing
you
are
married
have
children
said
i
too
serious
to
bother
about
tact
how
is
it
with
you
he
laughed
cynically
don
t
speak
of
my
family
said
he
i
tried
the
other
way
but
i
ve
given
up
several
years
ago
what
can
one
do
in
a
crazy
crowd
not
much
confessed
i
deeply
depressed
the
women
stampede
each
other
he
went
on
besides
no
american
woman
none
that
i
know
has
been
brought
up
with
education
enough
to
enable
her
to
make
a
life
for
herself
even
when
the
man
tries
to
help
her
to
like
an
occupation
to
do
anything
at
it
you
ve
got
to
understand
it
being
a
husband

father
is
an
occupation
the
most
important
one
in
the
world

mother
is
an
occupation
the
most
important
one
in
the
world
for
a
woman

american
men
and
women
brought
up
to
those
occupations
trained
in
them
prepared
for
them
the
most
they
know
is
a
smatter
at
the
pastime
of
lover
and
mistress
and
they
re
none
too
adept
at
that
i
believe
said
i
that
in
my
whole
life
i
ve
never
learned
so
much
in
so
short
a
time
it
ll
do
you
no
good
to
have
learned
rejoined
armitage
it
will
only
make
you
sad
or
bitter
according
to
your
mood
or
perhaps
some
day
you
may
reach
my
plane
of
indifference
and
be
amused
nothing
is
hopeless
said
i
the
american
woman
is
hopeless
said
he
her
vanity
is
triple
plated
copper
riveted
she
s
hopeless
so
long
as
the
american
man
will
give
her
the
money
to
buy
flattery
at
home
and
abroad
for
so
long
as
you
can
buy
flattery
you
never
find
out
the
truth
about
yourself
and
the
american
man
will
give
her
the
money
as
long
as
he
can
because
it
buys
him
peace
and
freedom
he
doesn
t
want
to
be
bothered
with
the
american
woman
except
when
he
s
in
a
certain
mood
that
doesn
t
last
long
there
are
exceptions
said
i
not
clear
as
to
what
i
meant
yes
there
are
exceptions
said
he
there
are
american
men
who
spend
time
with
the
american
woman
and
what
does
she
do
to
them
look
at
the
poor
asses
neglecting
their
business
letting
their
minds
go
to
seed
they
don
t
make
her
wise
she
makes
them
foolish
as
foolish
as
herself
and
her
children
you
may
perhaps
imagine
into
what
a
state
this
talk
of
armitage
s
threw
me
he
was
talking
generalities
but
every
word
he
spoke
went
straight
home
to
me
he
had
torn
the
coverings
from
my
inmost
family
life
had
exposed
its
soul
naked
and
ugly
to
my
fascinated
gaze
he
finished
dinner
lighted
a
cigarette
sat
back
watching
me
with
a
mysterious
smile
half
amused
wholly
sympathetic
upon
his
handsome
face
younger
than
his
forty
five
years
for
he
was
considerably
older
than
i
i
was
hardly
more
than
barely
conscious
of
that
look
of
his
or
of
his
presence
suddenly
i
struck
my
fist
with
violence
upon
the
arm
of
my
chair
and
i
said
i
will
do
something
it
is
not
hopeless
he
shook
his
head
slowly
at
the
same
time
exhaling
a
cloud
of
smoke
i
tried
godfrey
said
he
and
i
had
a
better
chance
of
success
than
you
could
possibly
have
for
my
wife
had
been
brought
up
by
a
sensible
father
and
mother
in
a
sensible
way
and
she
had
been
used
to
fashionable
society
all
her
life
and
when
i
married
her
seemed
to
have
proved
herself
immune
a
few
years
and
his
cynical
smile
may
not
have
been
genuine
she
leads
the
simpletons
but
you
ll
see
for
yourself
when
you
know
what
to
do
and
feel
as
you
do
said
i
why
did
you
suggest
our
going
into
your
society

i
why

because
i
wished
to

he
with

after

we
strolled
down
fifth
avenue
after
he
had
watched
the
stream
of
elegant
carriages
and
automobiles
some
of
the
too
elegant
automobiles
having
their
interiors
brightly
lighted
that
the
passersby
might
not
fail
to
see
the
elaborate
toilets
of
the
occupants
after
he
had
observed
this
procession
of
extravagance
and
vanity
with
only
an
occasional
derisive
laugh
or
look
there
don
t
miss
that
lady
he
burst
out
again
in
his
pleasantly
ironical
tone
how
fat
the
women
are
getting
the
automobile
women
and
how
the
candy
shops
are
multiplying
candy
and
automobiles
and
culture
let
us
not
forget
culture
no
indeed
said
i
grimly
let
s
not
forget
the
culture
i
was
telling
my
wife
yesterday
said
armitage
what
culture
is
it
is
talking
in
language
that
means
nothing
about
things
that
mean
less
than
nothing
but
watch
the
ladies
stream
by
all
got
up
in
their
gorgeous
raiment
and
jewels
what
have
they
ever
done
what
are
they
doing
that
entitles
them
to
so
much
more
than
their
poor
sisters
scuffling
along
on
the
sidewalk
here
they
ve
talked
and
are
talking
about
culture
said
i
and
don
t
forget
charity
ah
charity
cried
he
gayly
thank
you
i
see
we
understand
each
other
he
linked
his
arm
affectionately
in
mine
charity
it
s
the
other
half
of
a
lady
s
occupation
charity
having
no
fancy
for
attending
to
her
own
business
she
meddles
in
the
business
of
the
poor
tempting
them
to
become
liars
and
paupers
your
fine
lady
is
a
professional
patronizer
she
has
no
usefulness
to
contribute
to
the
world
so
she
patronizes
the
arts
with
her
culture
the
poor
with
her
charity
and
the
human
race
with
her
snobbishness
he
was
so
amused
by
his
train
of
thought
that
he
lapsed
into
silence
the
more
fully
to
enjoy
it
for
every
thought
has
its
shadings
that
cannot
be
expressed
in
words
yet
give
the
keenest
enjoyment
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
to
repeat
and
what
have
these
ladies
done
to
entitle
them
to
this
luxury
are
they
perchance
being
paid
for
giving
to
the
world
and
for
inspiring
the
noble
sons
and
daughters
who
drive
coaches
and
marry
titles
but
what
do
we
men
do
what
do
i
do
that
entitles
me
to
so
much
more
than
that
chap
perched
on
the
hansom
i
often
think
of
it
don
t
you
never
laughed
armitage
i
never
claw
my
own
sore
spots
there
s
no
fun
in
that
always
claw
the
other
fellow
s
there
s
a
laugh
and
distraction
for
your
own
troubles
in
seeing
him
wince
is
that
why
you
ve
been
clawing
mine
said
i
we
were
pausing
before
his
big
house
at
the
corner
of
the
avenue
if
i
have
been
i
didn
t
know
it
said
he
he
glanced
up
at
his
windows
with
a
satirical
smile
this
evening
i
ve
been
breaking
my
rule
and
clawing
at
my
own
he
put
out
his
hand
let
the
social
business
take
its
course
advised
he
with
impressive
friendliness
you
and
i
can
t
make
the
world
over
to
fight
against
the
inevitable
merely
increases
everyone
s
discomfort
perhaps
you
re
right
said
i
i
agreed
with
his
conclusion
that
it
was
best
to
let
things
alone
though
i
reached
that
conclusion
by
a
different
route
i
had
in
mind
my
forlorn
hope
of
good
results
from
a
homeopathic
treatment
i
saw
how
impossible
it
was
to
undo
the
practically
completed
training
of
a
grown
girl
i
appreciated
the
absurdity
of
an
attempt
radically
to
change
edna
s
character
an
absurdity
as
great
as
an
attempt
to
make
her
a
foot
taller
or
to
alter
the
color
of
her
eyes
the
one
hope
it
seemed
to
me
and
i
still
think
i
was
right
was
that
when
they
had
social
position
when
there
should
no
longer
be
excuse
for
fretting
lest
some
one
were
thinking
them
common
they
might
calm
down
toward
some
sort
of
sanity
bear
in
mind
please
that
at
the
time
i
did
not
have
the
situation
nor
any
idea
of
it
and
of
how
to
deal
with
it
definitely
and
clearly
in
mind
i
was
groping
was
seeing
dimly
was
not
even
sure
that
i
saw
at
all
i
was
like
a
thousand
other
busy
american
men
who
after
years
of
absorption
in
affairs
are
abruptly
and
rudely
awakened
to
the
fact
that
there
is
something
wrong
at
home
where
they
had
been
flattering
themselves
everything
was
all
right
the
things
armitage
had
said
occupied
my
mind
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
my
business
the
longer
i
revolved
them
the
better
i
understood
the
situation
at
home
i
could
not
but
wonder
what
wretched
catastrophe
in
his
domestic
life
had
made
him
so
insultingly
bitter
against
women
i
felt
that
he
was
unfair
to
them
any
judgment
that
condemned
a
class
for
possessing
universal
human
weakness
must
be
unfair
at
the
same
time
i
believed
he
had
excuse
for
being
unfair
the
excuse
of
a
man
whose
domestic
life
is
in
ruins
i
began
to
see
toward
the
bottom
of
the
woman
question
the
nature
and
the
cause
of
the
crisis
through
which
women
were
passing
the
modern
world
as
i
had
read
history
enough
to
know
had
suddenly
and
completely
revolutionized
the
conditions
of
life
the
male
sex
though
poorly
where
at
all
equipped
to
meet
the
new
conditions
still
was
compelled
to
meet
them
after
a
fashion
a
river
that
for
ages
has
moved
quietly
along
in
a
deep
bed
all
in
a
night
swells
to
many
times
its
former
size
and
plays
havoc
with
the
surrounding
country
that
was
a
fairly
good
figure
for
the
new
life
science
and
machinery
had
suddenly
forced
upon
the
human
race
the
men
living
in
the
inundated
region
where
floods
were
unknown
where
appliances
even
ideas
for
combating
them
did
not
exist
the
men
hastily
hysterically
incompetently
but
with
resolution
and
persistence
because
forced
by
dire
necessity
would
proceed
to
deal
with
that
vast
new
river
just
so
were
the
men
of
our
day
dealing
with
the
life
of
steam
and
electricity
of
ancient
landmarks
of
religion
and
morality
swept
away
or
shifted
of
ancient
industrial
and
social
relations
turned
upside
down
and
inside
out
the
men
were
coping
with
the
situation
after
a
fashion
but
the
women
these
unfortunate
creatures
faced
with
the
new
conditions
were
in
their
greater
ignorance
and
incapacity
and
helplessness
trying
to
live
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
as
if
the
old
order
still
existed
and
the
men
partly
through
ignorance
partly
through
preoccupation
with
the
new
order
partly
through
indifference
and
contempt
veiled
as
consideration
for
the
weaker
sex
were
encouraging
them
in
their
fatal
folly
was
it
strange
that
the
women
were
deceived
remained
unconscious
of
their
peril
no
it
was
on
the
contrary
inevitable
when
men
though
working
away
under
and
at
the
new
conditions
still
talked
as
if
the
old
conditions
prevailed
when
preachers
still
preached
that
way
and
orators
still
eulogized
the
thing
that
was
dead
and
buried
as
if
it
lived
and
reigned
when
in
order
to
find
out
the
change
you
had
to
disregard
the
speech
the
professions
the
confident
assertions
of
all
mankind
and
observe
closely
their
actions
only
when
there
was
this
universal
unawareness
and
unpreparedness
how
could
the
poor
women
be
condemned
i
could
not
but
admit
to
myself
that
in
his
account
of
the
doings
of
the
women
armitage
was
only
slightly
if
at
all
exaggerating
but
with
my
more
judicial
temperament
that
had
won
me
fortune
and
leadership
while
hardly
more
than
a
youth
i
could
not
join
him
in
damning
the
women
for
their
folly
and
idleness
and
uselessness
so
the
immediate
result
of
armitage
s
talk
was
a
gentler
and
thoroughly
tolerant
frame
of
mind
toward
my
wife
both
as
to
herself
and
as
to
what
she
had
done
to
our
daughter
after
all
i
had
for
wife
only
the
typical
woman
and
a
rarely
sweet
and
charming
example
of
the
type
and
my
daughter
was
no
worse
perhaps
was
better
than
the
average
girl
of
her
age
and
position
what
did
i
think
i
had
or
ought
to
have
in
the
way
of
wife
and
daughter
anyhow
what
was
this
vague
sentimental
dream
of
family
life
if
i
were
by
some
magic
to
find
myself
possessed
of
the
sort
of
family
i
thought
i
wanted
wouldn
t
i
be
more
dissatisfied
than
at
present
when
i
had
a
wife
and
a
daughter
who
looked
so
well
and
did
nothing
but
what
everyone
around
me
regarded
as
right
and
proper
was
i
not
unjust
in
my
discontent
i
had
not
seen
edna
or
margot
for
several
days
before
my
talk
with
bob
armitage
i
did
not
see
edna
for
several
days
afterwards
though
i
dined
at
home
every
evening
and
did
not
go
out
after
dinner
i
was
debating
how
to
make
overtures
toward
a
reconciliation
when
she
came
into
my
study
she
had
an
air
of
coldness
and
constraint
the
air
of
the
woman
who
is
inflicting
severe
punishment
upon
an
offending
husband
by
withholding
herself
from
him
she
said
mrs
robert
armitage
has
asked
me
to
dine
on
thursday
evening
i
replied
hesitatingly
thursday
i
ve
an
engagement
for
thursday
a
dinner
in
her
agitation
she
did
not
note
that
i
had
not
finished
dropping
her
coldness
she
flashed
out
fiercely
we
ve
simply
got
to
accept
it
s
our
chance
we
may
not
have
it
again
it
s
what
i
ve
been
waiting
for
ever
since
we
moved
to
this
house
and
i
can
t
go
alone
oh
how
selfish
you
are
you
never
think
of
anything
but
your
own
comfort
and
you
can
t
or
won
t
realize
any
of
the
higher
things
of
life
for
which
i
m
striving
it
is
too
horrible
if
any
male
reader
of
this
story
has
known
a
woman
who
was
up
to
a
certain
time
always
able
to
rouse
a
strong
emotion
in
him
of
love
or
anger
of
pleasure
or
pain
a
woman
toward
whom
he
could
not
be
lukewarm
and
if
that
reader
can
recall
the
day
on
which
he
faced
that
woman
in
a
situation
of
stress
and
found
himself
calm
and
patient
and
kind
toward
her
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
edna
was
not
moving
me
her
loveliness
did
not
stir
a
single
tiny
flame
of
passion
her
abuse
did
not
excite
resentment
or
dread
just
a
moment
my
dear
said
i
with
the
tranquillity
of
a
judge
i
was
trying
to
say
that
i
would
break
my
engagement
i
saw
that
she
did
not
believe
me
but
imagined
her
outburst
had
terrified
and
cowed
me
into
submission
how
dispassionately
i
observed
and
judged
accept
if
you
wish
i
went
on
i
like
armitage
we
ve
been
friends
for
years
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
so
demanded
she
why
have
you
been
plotting
against
me
all
this
time
you
forbade
me
to
speak
of
business
said
i
so
i
have
never
spoken
of
my
business
friends
her
anger
against
me
was
almost
beyond
control
if
she
had
been
a
lady
born
if
she
had
not
had
a
past
to
live
down
a
childhood
of
vulgar
surroundings
and
actions
she
would
have
given
way
and
abused
like
a
fish
wife
a
lady
born
dares
excesses
of
passion
that
a
made
lady
with
her
deep
reverence
for
the
ladylike
would
shrink
from
she
said
through
clinched
teeth
i
find
out
that
mrs
armitage
the
leader
of
the
younger
set
the
most
fashionable
woman
in
new
york
has
been
eager
to
know
me
for
a
long
time
and
you
have
been
preventing
it
how
said
i
amused
but
not
showing
it
she
called
here
the
other
day
she
was
as
friendly
as
could
be
we
became
friends
at
once
she
said
that
for
months
she
had
been
at
her
husband
to
get
her
leave
to
call
on
me
but
that
he
and
you
between
you
had
neglected
to
arrange
it
i
saw
how
this
notion
of
the
matter
delighted
her
and
that
the
truth
would
enrage
her
would
make
her
dislike
me
more
than
ever
so
i
held
my
peace
and
thought
for
the
first
time
i
believe
how
tiresome
a
woman
without
a
sense
of
humor
could
become
how
tryingly
tiresome
she
and
i
are
going
to
do
a
lot
of
things
together
continued
edna
in
the
same
intense
humorless
way
i
always
knew
that
if
i
got
a
chance
to
talk
with
one
of
those
women
who
could
appreciate
me
i
d
have
no
further
trouble
i
knew
i
was
wasting
time
on
those
religious
fakirs
and
frumps
but
i
was
always
hoping
that
through
them
i
d
somehow
meet
a
woman
of
my
own
sort
now
i
ve
met
her
and
something
tells
me
i
ll
have
no
further
trouble
probably
you
re
right
said
i
how
it
infuriates
me
she
went
on
to
think
i
d
have
been
spared
all
the
humiliations
and
heartaches
i
ve
suffered
if
you
had
used
your
influence
with
robert
armitage
months
years
ago
but
no
you
don
t
want
me
to
get
on
you
wanted
to
stick
in
the
mud
so
i
had
to
suffer
and
margot
too
well
it
s
all
right
now
said
i
probably
as
indifferently
as
i
felt
why
had
god
seen
fit
to
create
women
without
the
sense
of
humor
perhaps
to
save
men
from
falling
altogether
under
their
rule
the
sufferings
of
that
poor
child
cried
edna
and
the
very
day
after
mrs
armitage
came
gracie
fortescue
asked
her
to
a
party
and
all
the
girls
have
taken
her
up
gracie
fortescue
is
a
niece
of
hilda
armitage
her
brother
married
a
fortescue
really
said
i
and
margot
is
happy
no
thanks
to
you
retorted
edna
sourly
well
plunge
in
my
dear
said
i
beginning
to
examine
the
papers
before
me
on
the
desk
only
spare
me
as
much
as
possible
i
need
all
my
time
and
strength
for
my
work
but
you
ll
have
to
go
with
me
to
dinners
and
to
the
opera
occasionally
i
can
t
do
this
thing
altogether
alone
say
i
m
an
invalid
say
i
m
away
they
don
t
want
me
anyhow
armitage
doesn
t
go
with
his
wife
but
that
s
different
cried
she
in
a
fever
she
has
always
had
social
position
it
doesn
t
matter
if
people
do
talk
scandal
about
her
i
can
t
afford
to
cause
gossip
why
should
they
gossip
but
no
matter
i
don
t
want
to
worry
with
that
that
higher
life
let
us
call
it
or
to
be
worried
with
it
do
the
best
you
can
for
me
i
m
a
man
s
man
always
have
been
always
shall
be
if
you
ve
got
to
have
a
man
to
take
you
about
dig
up
one
somewhere
i
m
willing
to
pay
him
well
always
money
exclaimed
she
in
deep
disgust
i
laughed
not
a
bad
thing
money
said
i
it
would
never
have
got
me
mrs
armitage
s
friendship
said
she
loftily
you
think
so
said
i
amiably
all
right
if
it
pleases
you
but
take
my
advice
my
dear
enjoy
yourself
to
the
limit
with
highfaluting
talk
about
the
worthlessness
of
money
and
that
sort
of
rot
but
don
t
for
a
minute
lose
your
point
of
view
and
convince
yourself
thank
god
i
ve
got
a
vein
of
refinement
of
idealism
in
my
nature
said
edna
i
wouldn
t
have
as
sordid
an
opinion
of
human
nature
as
you
have
for
anything
in
the
world
you
can
afford
not
to
have
it
my
dear
said
i
so
long
as
i
know
the
truth
and
so
make
the
necessary
money
to
keep
us
going
you
are
free
to
indulge
your
lovely
delusions
have
your
beautiful
unmercenary
friendship
with
mrs
armitage
and
the
other
ladies
i
ll
continue
to
make
it
financially
worth
their
husbands
while
to
encourage
the
friendships
i
thought
so
cried
she
you
believe
mrs
armitage
has
taken
me
up
for
business
reasons
if
you
had
been
some
poor
woman
i
began
mildly
don
t
be
absurd
cried
my
wife
how
could
there
be
an
equal
and
true
friendship
between
mrs
armitage
and
a
woman
with
none
of
the
surroundings
of
a
lady
and
with
no
means
of
gratifying
the
tastes
of
a
lady
but
that
doesn
t
mean
that
mrs
armitage
is
a
low
sordid
woman
she
has
a
beautiful
nature
money
is
merely
the
background
of
high
society
it
simply
gives
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
opportunity
to
set
the
standards
of
dress
and
manners
and
taste
and
of
course
they
re
careful
whom
they
associate
with
who
wants
to
be
annoyed
by
adventurers
and
climbers
and
all
sorts
of
dreadful
mercenary
self
seeking
people
who
indeed
said
i
it
gently
appealed
to
my
sense
of
the
ridiculous
to
see
my
wife
thus
changed
in
a
twinkling
into
a
defender
and
exponent
of
fashionable
society
it
was
so
deliciously
feminine
as
fantastically
humorless
her
sincere
belief
in
the
poppycock
she
was
reeling
off
the
twaddle
with
which
mrs
armitage
had
doubtless
stuffed
her
the
sordidness
the
vulgarity
the
meanness
the
petty
cruelty
the
snobbishness
of
fashionable
people
all
forgotten
in
a
moment
hastily
covered
deep
with
the
gilt
and
the
tinsel
of
hypocritical
virtues
what
an
amusing
ass
the
human
animal
is
how
stupidly
unconscious
of
its
own
motives
how
eagerly
it
attributes
to
itself
all
kinds
of
high
motives
for
the
ordinary
or
scrubby
or
downright
mean
actions
and
attributes
the
same
motives
to
its
fellow
asses
to
make
its
own
pretenses
the
more
plausible
an
amusing
ass
but
it
would
be
more
amusing
if
it
were
not
so
monotonously
solemn
but
laughed
at
itself
occasionally
however
the
atmosphere
of
our
home
now
steadily
improved
the
servants
began
to
respect
us
where
they
had
despised
and
had
scarcely
troubled
themselves
to
conceal
their
contempt
the
cook
sent
up
more
attractive
though
i
fear
even
less
digestible
dishes
the
butler
addressed
me
with
a
gratifying
servility
the
maids
developed
unexpected
talents
showing
acquaintance
with
the
needs
and
customs
of
a
fashionable
household
the
housekeeper
s
soul
dropped
from
its
theretofore
insolently
erect
posture
to
all
fours
and
she
attended
to
her
duties
edna
became
sweet
and
gracious
margot
grew
merry
and
affectionate
all
the
result
of
mrs
armitage
we
had
been
pariahs
we
were
of
the
elect
i
saw
and
felt
the
change
distinctly
at
the
time
but
it
is
only
in
retrospect
that
i
take
the
full
measure
get
its
full
humor
and
pathos
that
armitage
dinner
was
the
event
of
edna
s
life
she
had
been
born
she
had
married
she
had
given
birth
all
memorable
and
important
occurrences
but
this
formal
d
but
in
fashionable
society
topped
them
as
the
peak
tops
the
foothills
having
seen
her
quivering
and
hysterical
excitement
when
we
were
leaving
the
house
i
feared
a
breakdown
i
marveled
at
her
apparent
calmness
and
ease
as
we
entered
the
dining
room
of
the
armitages
never
had
she
looked
so
well
if
mrs
armitage
had
not
been
a
self
satisfied
beauty
of
the
dark
type
she
might
have
demolished
edna
s
dream
in
its
very
realizing
but
no
doubt
edna
the
shrewd
had
duly
measured
hilda
armitage
and
had
discovered
that
it
was
safe
to
make
her
proud
of
the
woman
she
had
taken
under
protection
and
patronage
there
were
but
a
dozen
people
in
all
at
the
dinner
it
did
not
seem
to
be
much
of
an
affair
the
drawing
room
was
plain
nothing
gaudy
nothing
costly
looking
our
own
dining
room
was
much
grander
to
our
then
uneducated
taste
the
guests
were
just
people
simple
good
natured
mortals
perfectly
at
their
ease
and
putting
us
at
our
ease
you
would
have
wondered
after
five
minutes
of
that
company
how
anyone
could
possibly
find
any
difficulty
in
getting
intimately
acquainted
with
them
but
as
edna
knew
at
a
glance
she
and
i
were
in
the
midst
of
the
innermost
and
smallest
circle
of
the
many
circles
one
within
another
that
make
up
new
york
fashionable
society
if
on
the
recommendation
of
the
armitages
we
should
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
accepted
by
that
circle
of
circles
that
circle
within
the
circles
there
would
be
nothing
of
a
social
nature
left
for
us
to
conquer
in
new
york
i
was
ignorant
of
all
this
at
the
time
had
i
known
i
imagine
i
should
have
remained
tranquil
but
edna
knew
at
a
glance
she
had
been
studying
these
matters
for
years
it
shows
what
force
of
character
she
had
that
she
conducted
herself
as
if
it
were
the
most
ordinary
and
familiar
occasion
of
her
life
she
had
always
said
even
away
back
in
the
days
of
the
grand
forty
dollars
a
month
flat
in
passaic
that
she
belonged
at
the
social
top
she
was
undoubtedly
right
the
way
she
acted
when
she
arrived
there
proved
it
you
do
not
often
have
the
chance
gentle
reader
to
get
so
well
acquainted
with
any
human
being
as
i
have
enabled
you
to
get
with
edna
probably
you
do
not
even
know
yourself
so
well
therefore
i
suspect
that
you
have
a
wholly
false
notion
of
her
think
her
in
every
way
much
worse
relatively
than
she
was
through
your
novels
and
through
the
reports
your
dim
eyes
bring
to
your
narrow
and
shallow
mind
you
have
acquired
certain
habits
of
judging
your
fellow
beings
you
attach
inflated
importance
to
their
unimportant
surface
qualities
physical
appearance
pleasant
voice
and
manner
and
to
their
amiable
little
hypocrisies
of
apparent
sweetness
and
generosity
and
friendliness
you
do
not
see
the
real
person
the
human
being
you
being
by
training
a
hypocrite
and
a
believer
in
hypocrisies
scorn
human
beings
now
i
prefer
them
to
the
sort
of
people
with
whom
you
and
your
false
literature
populate
the
world
in
making
you
acquainted
with
edna
and
the
others
in
my
story
i
have
not
introduced
you
to
bad
people
monsters
but
to
real
beings
of
usual
types
probably
on
the
whole
superior
to
your
smug
self
in
all
the
good
qualities
had
you
seen
edna
in
the
armitage
house
that
evening
you
would
have
thought
her
as
incapable
of
calculation
and
snobbishness
as
well
as
any
of
the
others
in
that
company
whose
whole
lives
were
made
up
of
calculation
and
snobbishness
she
and
they
looked
so
refined
and
elevated
she
and
they
talked
so
high
mindedly
i
who
knew
almost
nothing
at
that
time
except
business
was
listener
rather
than
talker
and
you
may
be
sure
such
a
man
as
i
having
such
ignorance
as
mine
to
cover
up
had
in
years
of
practice
become
somewhat
adept
in
that
saving
art
for
the
intelligent
ignorant
but
edna
she
the
most
expert
of
smatterers
fairly
shone
with
her
beauty
and
vivacity
her
eloquent
eyes
and
dazzling
smile
and
exquisite
bare
shoulders
to
aid
her
she
created
an
impression
of
brilliancy
you
had
a
good
time
said
i
when
we
were
in
the
motor
for
the
home
journey
i
never
had
as
good
a
time
in
my
life
she
exclaimed
her
voice
tremulous
with
ecstasy
did
i
look
well
never
so
well
said
i
and
you
made
a
hit
i
was
careful
to
cultivate
the
women
said
she
i
ve
got
to
get
the
women
you
ve
got
them
i
declared
sincerely
you
re
sure
i
didn
t
make
some
of
them
jealous
did
you
see
any
signs
they
liked
you
said
i
i
had
to
play
my
cards
well
pursued
she
it
was
a
difficult
position
i
was
far
and
away
the
best
looking
woman
there
with
the
possible
exception
of
mrs
armitage
did
you
hear
her
call
me
edna
you
and
mrs
armitage
look
well
together
you
are
of
about
the
same
figure
and
the
contrast
of
coloring
is
very
good
that
s
why
we
took
to
each
other
so
quickly
each
of
us
sets
off
the
other
how
did
you
like
armitage
i
asked
oh
well
enough
said
she
indifferently
i
hardly
noticed
him
or
the
other
men
i
had
my
game
to
play
the
men
don
t
count
in
the
social
game
it
s
the
women
i
shall
be
nervous
until
i
find
out
whether
i
really
got
them
they
are
such
cats
so
mean
and
sly
and
jealous
i
detest
women
i
prefer
men
myself
said
i
men
she
laughed
scornfully
i
think
men
are
intolerable
american
men
they
say
foreigners
are
better
but
american
men
they
know
nothing
but
dull
business
or
politics
they
have
no
breadth
no
idealism
the
women
are
far
superior
to
the
men
i
laughed
no
doubt
you
women
are
too
good
for
us
said
i
carelessly
we
re
grateful
that
you
don
t
scorn
us
too
much
even
to
accept
our
money
how
coarse
that
is
don
t
spoil
the
happiest
evening
of
my
life
we
were
at
home
so
she
could
escape
from
me
and
i
for
my
part
was
as
glad
to
be
quit
of
her
society
as
she
could
possibly
have
been
to
get
rid
of
me
i
was
beginning
to
realize
that
her
conversation
bored
me
that
it
had
always
bored
me
that
it
was
her
sex
and
only
her
sex
that
interested
me
and
latterly
even
this
had
lost
its
charm
why
i
have
observed
and
perhaps
you
have
observed
it
too
that
people
of
wealth
and
position
unless
they
have
very
striking
individuality
indeed
are
usually
utterly
devoid
of
charm
it
is
difficult
to
become
interested
in
them
to
establish
any
sort
of
sympathetic
current
and
you
will
notice
that
fashionable
functions
are
dull
essentially
dull
that
the
animation
is
artificial
is
supplied
from
without
by
an
orchestra
or
entertainers
and
fails
to
infect
the
company
it
was
long
before
i
discovered
the
explanation
for
this
i
at
first
thought
it
was
the
stupidity
that
comes
from
a
surfeit
of
the
luxuries
and
pleasures
but
i
am
now
convinced
that
this
familiar
explanation
is
not
the
true
one
that
the
true
one
is
the
excessive
the
really
preposterous
self
centeredness
of
people
of
rank
and
wealth
from
waking
until
sleeping
they
are
surrounded
by
hirelings
and
sycophants
who
think
and
talk
only
of
them
thus
the
rich
man
or
woman
gets
into
the
habit
of
concentrating
upon
self
now
the
essence
of
charm
is
giving
giving
oneself
out
in
sympathetic
interest
in
one
s
fellows
how
can
people
all
whose
faculties
are
trained
to
work
in
upon
themselves
how
can
they
have
charm
an
egotist
one
who
talks
only
of
himself
may
have
charm
because
he
gives
you
the
impression
that
he
is
trying
to
please
you
that
he
thinks
you
so
important
that
he
wishes
you
to
be
sensible
of
his
importance
but
the
egotist
who
whatever
he
talks
thinks
only
of
himself
he
is
not
only
dull
and
bored
but
also
a
diffuser
of
dullness
and
boredom
and
that
is
how
their
servants
and
their
sycophants
make
the
rich
and
the
fashionable
so
dreary
i
imagine
some
such
effect
as
this
was
being
produced
upon
my
wife
by
her
surroundings
of
luxury
i
think
that
may
account
for
her
long
decreasing
charm
for
me
at
any
rate
soon
after
she
was
well
launched
on
her
elysian
sea
of
fashion
that
is
to
say
soon
after
she
ceased
to
have
any
check
of
social
seeking
to
restrain
her
from
centering
all
her
thoughts
and
actions
upon
herself
she
lost
the
last
bit
of
her
charm
for
me
she
became
radiantly
beautiful
her
face
took
on
a
serene
and
refinedly
assured
expression
that
made
her
extravagantly
admired
on
every
hand
she
became
gracious
to
me
and
almost
as
sweet
as
she
had
been
before
we
moved
to
new
york
she
even
let
me
see
that
if
i
so
desired
she
would
condescend
to
be
on
terms
of
wifely
affection
with
me
again
but
i
did
not
so
desire
i
liked
her
i
admired
her
energy
her
toilets
and
quite
impersonally
her
aristocratic
beauty
but
i
was
content
to
be
a
bachelor
and
i
was
grateful
when
she
began
to
relieve
me
of
the
tediousness
of
going
about
in
her
train
my
substitute
was
an
architect
leon
macilvane
by
name
a
handsome
young
fellow
of
about
my
wife
s
age
though
he
thought
her
much
younger
despite
margot
s
age
and
appearance
with
his
poetic
dark
eyes
and
classic
features
and
rich
deep
voice
macilvane
had
long
been
a
favorite
with
the
young
married
women
of
the
armitage
set
he
was
indeed
a
valuable
asset
the
rich
unmarried
men
were
not
especially
interesting
also
they
were
needed
by
the
marriageable
girls
macilvane
not
a
marrying
man
and
never
making
any
mother
uneasy
by
so
much
as
an
interested
glance
at
a
daughter
intended
for
a
rich
husband
devoted
himself
to
married
women
i
do
not
care
for
girls
he
said
to
me
they
are
too
colorless
why
bother
with
women
at
all
said
i
aren
t
they
all
colorless
what
do
they
know
about
life
what
experience
have
they
had
an
intelligent
woman
s
mind
is
the
complement
of
an
intelligent
man
s
mind
said
he
as
if
this
trite
old
fallacy
were
a
brilliant
discovery
of
his
own
making
women
stimulate
me
give
me
ideas
oh
i
see
said
i
practically
business
yes
an
architect
does
deal
chiefly
with
the
women
i
didn
t
mean
that
said
he
showing
as
much
anger
as
he
dared
show
the
husband
of
the
woman
to
whom
he
had
attached
himself
where
s
the
harm
in
it
said
i
encouragingly
you
ve
got
to
make
a
living
haven
t
you
it
s
good
sense
for
a
business
man
to
cultivate
his
customers
he
the
poseur
and
the
small
man
hated
this
plain
truthful
way
of
dealing
with
his
profession
like
all
chaps
of
that
kidney
he
thought
only
of
himself
and
of
appearances
and
sought
to
degrade
a
noble
profession
to
the
base
uses
of
his
vanity
in
fact
he
had
begun
with
my
wife
because
of
the
orders
he
hoped
to
get
for
he
suspected
that
once
she
looked
about
her
in
the
fashionable
world
from
the
new
viewpoint
of
a
fashionable
person
she
would
want
changes
in
her
house
to
make
it
less
vividly
grand
he
believed
she
would
let
hilda
armitage
educate
her
and
hilda
unlike
most
of
her
friends
liked
the
quiet
kinds
of
ostentation
and
costliness
and
he
guessed
correctly
he
was
well
paid
for
undertaking
to
replace
me
as
escort
so
far
as
i
could
be
replaced
without
causing
scandal
and
thank
heaven
that
was
very
far
in
the
new
york
of
busy
and
bored
husbands
detesting
the
gaudy
gaddings
their
wives
loved
soon
he
was
serving
my
wife
for
other
reasons
than
pay
i
saw
something
of
him
from
time
to
time
and
i
presently
began
to
note
a
change
in
his
manner
toward
me
a
formal
politeness
an
exaggeration
of
courtesy
i
spoke
to
armitage
about
it
armitage
and
i
had
become
the
most
intimate
of
friends
knocked
about
together
in
the
evenings
were
more
closely
associated
than
ever
in
business
bob
said
i
to
armitage
what
ails
that
ass
macilvane
he
treats
me
as
if
he
were
in
love
with
my
wife
armitage
laughed
that
s
it
said
he
my
wife
s
spaniel
courtleigh
who
writes
poetry
treats
me
the
same
way
get
any
anonymous
letters
yet
two
said
i
servants
said
he
i
suppose
you
burnt
them
you
didn
t
show
them
to
your
wife
heavens
no
replied
i
why
unsettle
her
why
upset
a
pleasant
arrangement
my
wife
finds
macilvane
useful
i
find
him
invaluable
he
saves
me
hours
of
time
he
spares
me
hours
of
boredom
my
feeling
about
courtleigh
said
armitage
and
both
those
chaps
are
comfortably
trustworthy
i
hadn
t
thought
of
macilvane
in
that
way
said
i
i
know
my
wife
and
that
s
enough
armitage
reflected
with
an
amused
smile
on
his
face
finally
he
said
i
don
t
suppose
there
ever
were
since
the
world
began
so
thoroughly
trustworthy
women
as
these
american
women
of
the
fashionable
crowd
those
that
have
very
rich
husbands
and
only
those
of
course
are
really
fashionable
they
may
flirt
a
little
but
never
anything
serious
never
anything
that
d
give
their
husbands
an
excuse
for
throwing
them
out
and
lose
them
their
big
houses
and
big
incomes
and
social
leadership
i
had
not
thought
of
these
aspects
of
the
matter
i
based
my
feeling
of
security
solely
on
my
knowledge
of
my
wife
s
intense
self
absorption
all
the
springs
of
sentiment
except
the
shallow
spring
of
highfaluting
talk
had
dried
up
in
her
she
would
listen
to
macilvane
s
flatteries
as
long
as
he
cared
to
pour
them
out
but
if
he
ever
tried
to
get
her
to
think
of
him
she
would
feel
outraged
i
suppose
pursued
armitage
we
d
be
tremendously
amused
if
we
could
overhear
those
chaps
talking
to
our
wives
about
us
they
don
t
dare
presume
to
the
extent
of
mentioning
our
names
but
they
hand
out
generalities
of
roasting
how
stupid
most
american
men
are
how
superior
the
women
are
what
a
tragic
condescension
for
a
wonderful
american
woman
to
have
to
live
with
a
man
who
couldn
t
appreciate
her
i
nodded
and
laughed
nothing
a
woman
loves
so
much
an
american
woman
with
a
little
miseducation
befogging
her
mind
and
fooling
her
as
to
its
limited
extent
nothing
she
so
dearly
loves
as
to
hear
that
she
has
a
great
intellect
and
a
great
soul
complex
mysterious
beyond
the
comprehension
of
the
vulgar
male
clods
about
her
that
s
why
they
like
foreigners
you
ought
to
watch
those
foreign
chaps
flatter
our
women
make
perfect
fools
of
them
but
i
had
no
desire
to
watch
women
in
any
circumstances
i
had
no
active
resentment
against
them
as
had
armitage
i
simply
wished
to
be
let
alone
to
be
free
to
pursue
my
ambitions
and
my
ideas
of
self
development
i
had
ceased
to
feel
about
margot
i
was
merely
glad
she
was
not
a
boy
for
i
felt
that
if
she
were
a
boy
i
should
have
to
assert
myself
and
do
some
drastic
and
disagreeable
and
almost
certainly
disastrous
disciplining
in
my
family
about
a
year
and
a
half
after
my
wife
achieved
her
ambition
i
began
to
feel
that
she
was
spiritually
bearing
down
upon
me
in
pursuance
of
some
new
secret
plan
during
the
year
and
a
half
she
had
been
playing
the
fashionable
social
game
with
the
strenuous
enthusiasm
which
only
a
woman
i
had
almost
said
only
an
american
woman
seems
able
to
inject
into
the
pursuit
of
objects
that
are
of
no
consequences
whatsoever
and
in
spite
of
the
useful
macilvane
i
had
been
compelled
to
assist
her
far
more
than
was
to
my
liking
i
went
about
enough
to
get
a
thorough
insight
into
fashionableness
and
a
profound
distaste
for
it
of
the
many
phases
ludicrous
repellent
despicable
pitiful
there
was
one
that
made
a
deep
impression
upon
me
it
amazed
me
to
find
that
the
best
class
of
people
was
if
possible
more
vulgarly
snobbish
than
the
class
from
which
i
had
come
even
than
the
brooklyn
bounders
i
could
not
comprehend
i
cannot
comprehend
how
those
who
have
had
the
best
opportunities
are
no
more
intelligent
no
broader
of
mind
than
those
who
have
had
no
opportunities
at
all
the
ignorance
the
narrowness
of
the
men
and
women
of
the
comfortable
classes
the
laziness
of
their
minds
the
shallow
cant
about
literature
art
and
the
like
really
intelligence
activity
of
mind
seems
confined
to
the
few
who
are
pushing
upward
and
the
masses
of
mankind
in
all
classes
seem
contented
each
class
with
its
own
peculiar
wallow
of
ignorance
but
to
edna
s
secret
plan
if
you
are
a
married
man
you
will
at
once
understand
what
i
mean
when
i
speak
of
having
a
vague
sensation
of
being
borne
down
upon
she
said
nothing
she
did
nothing
but
i
knew
she
was
making
ready
to
ask
something
to
which
she
believed
she
could
get
my
consent
only
by
the
use
of
all
her
tact
and
skill
and
charm
for
she
did
not
know
her
charms
had
ceased
to
charm
but
thought
them
more
potent
than
ever
i
waited
with
patience
and
composure
and
in
due
time
she
began
cautious
open
approaches
margot
is
almost
ready
to
come
out
said
she
money
said
i
smiling
she
rebuked
this
coarseness
amiably
everybody
isn
t
always
thinking
of
money
dear
said
she
but
why
talk
to
me
about
anything
else
that
s
my
only
department
in
the
family
she
deigned
a
smile
for
my
pleasantry
then
went
on
in
her
usual
serious
way
i
wish
to
consult
you
about
her
education
oh
finish
as
you
ve
begun
said
i
i
suppose
it
s
the
best
that
can
be
done
for
a
girl
but
i
can
t
find
what
i
want
said
she
with
an
expression
of
sweet
maternal
solicitude
i
ve
always
been
determined
margot
should
have
the
best
education
any
girl
in
the
whole
world
could
get
go
ahead
said
i
see
that
she
gets
it
she
shall
have
the
perfect
equipment
of
a
lady
of
a
woman
of
the
world
continued
edna
with
growing
enthusiasm
she
has
the
beauty
to
set
it
off
and
we
can
afford
to
give
it
to
her
i
am
willing
to
make
any
sacrifices
that
may
be
necessary
i
pricked
up
my
ears
i
always
do
when
anyone
male
or
female
uses
that
word
sacrifice
i
know
a
piece
of
selfishness
is
coming
as
i
was
saying
pursued
edna
with
the
serene
look
of
the
self
confident
woman
who
is
taking
her
husband
in
firm
strong
hands
i
have
been
unable
to
find
what
i
want
for
her
mrs
armitage
tells
me
i
ll
not
find
it
except
in
paris
well
why
not
go
to
paris
said
i
did
you
ever
lift
an
empty
box
that
you
thought
full
and
heavy
my
wife
looked
as
if
she
had
just
done
that
exceedingly
uncomfortable
thing
but
i
don
t
see
i
i
it
would
be
a
terrible
sacrifice
to
have
to
go
and
live
in
paris
stammered
she
then
don
t
do
it
said
i
but
i
must
think
of
margot
exclaimed
she
hastily
oh
margot
seems
to
be
stepping
along
all
right
she
ll
never
miss
what
she
doesn
t
know
about
but
you
must
realize
dear
what
an
education
she
d
get
in
paris
and
i
suppose
it
would
do
me
good
too
it
s
a
shame
that
i
don
t
speak
french
everyone
except
me
speaks
it
they
all
had
french
governesses
when
they
were
children
some
of
them
had
and
some
hadn
t
said
i
armitage
has
told
me
things
about
your
friends
that
make
me
suspect
they
re
doing
fully
as
much
bluffing
as
we
are
she
winced
and
sighed
the
sigh
of
the
lady
patient
with
a
low
husband
then
you
think
i
ought
to
go
said
she
i
think
you
ought
to
do
as
you
like
said
i
i
always
have
thought
so
i
always
shall
and
continued
she
absently
the
society
over
there
must
be
charming
really
i
need
the
education
as
much
as
margot
does
i
do
surprisingly
well
considering
what
my
early
opportunities
were
i
ve
never
once
heard
you
give
yourself
away
said
i
i
m
not
that
stupid
replied
she
but
a
while
in
france
on
the
continent
and
in
england
perhaps
how
long
would
you
be
gone
interrupted
i
to
show
her
that
all
this
beating
round
robin
s
barn
was
superfluous
she
gave
me
a
coquettish
look
how
long
could
you
spare
me
i
can
t
tell
till
i
ve
tried
said
i
with
a
gallant
smile
but
with
no
move
toward
her
you
women
who
would
be
wise
distrust
the
gallantry
that
is
content
with
speech
and
look
you
understand
pursued
she
if
i
started
this
thing
i
d
put
it
through
no
matter
how
much
i
missed
you
or
how
homesick
i
was
over
there
you
always
do
put
things
through
said
i
admiringly
when
have
you
planned
to
start
i
haven
t
planned
at
all
as
yet
replied
she
and
i
saw
she
thought
i
had
set
a
trap
for
her
and
was
delighted
with
herself
for
having
dodged
it
certainly
never
was
there
a
husband
with
whom
indirection
was
more
unnecessary
yet
she
would
not
realize
this
partly
because
she
had
never
bothered
to
discover
what
manner
of
man
i
was
partly
because
she
had
one
of
those
natures
that
move
only
by
secrecy
and
indirection
do
you
expect
me
to
go
over
with
you
inquired
i
i
only
wish
you
would
exclaimed
she
but
i
distrusted
her
enthusiasm
couldn
t
macilvane
take
you
over
and
settle
you
her
face
clouded
her
lip
curled
slightly
i
don
t
like
him
as
i
did
said
she
i
ve
found
out
he
s
ridiculously
vain
and
egotistical
i
laughed
outright
what
is
it
inquired
she
elevating
her
eyebrows
she
had
always
disapproved
my
sense
of
humor
so
he
s
been
making
love
to
you
eh
said
i
no
indeed
cried
she
bridling
haughtily
he
d
not
dare
but
i
saw
he
was
beginning
to
presume
in
that
direction
and
i
checked
him
oh
he
s
harmless
said
i
keep
friendly
with
him
he
d
be
the
very
person
to
settle
you
in
paris
he
lived
there
several
years
it
would
cause
scandal
said
she
if
you
can
t
go
i
can
do
well
enough
alone
i
m
sure
i
d
only
be
in
the
way
said
i
let
me
know
when
you
wish
to
go
and
i
ll
try
to
arrange
it
but
i
can
t
get
away
for
at
least
three
months
that
would
be
too
late
said
she
margot
must
be
started
at
once
she
hasn
t
any
too
much
time
before
her
coming
out
also
mrs
armitage
is
sailing
in
two
weeks
and
she
would
be
a
great
help
then
you
have
decided
to
sail
in
two
weeks
said
i
adding
before
she
had
time
to
get
beyond
a
gathering
frown
of
protest
that
suits
me
i
ll
make
my
own
plans
accordingly
and
in
two
weeks
they
sailed
i
watching
the
big
ship
creep
out
of
dock
and
drop
slowly
down
the
river
armitage
and
i
drove
away
from
the
pier
together
we
were
in
such
high
spirits
that
we
had
champagne
with
our
lunch
vi
armitage
and
i
were
together
every
day
he
attracted
me
for
the
usual
reason
of
congeniality
and
also
because
he
was
giving
me
a
liberal
education
i
have
never
cared
for
books
or
with
two
or
three
exceptions
for
book
men
about
both
there
is
for
me
an
atmosphere
of
staleness
of
tedium
i
prefer
to
get
what
is
in
the
few
worth
while
books
through
the
medium
of
some
clear
and
original
mind
such
a
mind
as
armitage
had
he
ought
to
have
been
a
great
man
no
he
was
a
great
man
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
his
talents
ought
to
have
won
his
greatness
recognition
he
did
not
lack
capacity
or
energy
he
showed
a
high
degree
of
both
in
the
management
and
increase
of
his
fortune
he
lacked
that
species
of
vanity
i
guess
it
is
which
spurs
a
man
to
make
himself
conspicuous
also
he
had
a
kind
of
laziness
and
chose
to
be
active
only
in
the
way
that
was
easiest
and
most
agreeable
for
him
the
making
of
money
his
father
had
been
rich
and
his
grandfather
his
great
grandfather
had
been
one
of
the
richest
men
in
revolutionary
times
his
father
was
regarded
as
a
crank
because
he
had
imagination
and
therefore
despised
the
conventional
ideas
of
his
own
generation
to
be
regarded
as
thoroughly
sane
and
sensible
you
must
be
careful
to
be
neither
but
to
pattern
yourself
painstakingly
upon
the
particular
form
of
feeble
mindedness
and
conventional
silliness
current
in
your
time
armitage
s
father
resolved
that
his
son
should
not
have
his
individuality
clipped
and
moulded
and
patterned
by
college
and
caste
into
the
familiar
type
of
upper
class
man
so
armitage
went
to
public
school
graduated
from
it
into
a
factory
then
into
an
office
himself
earned
the
money
to
carry
out
the
ambitions
for
study
and
travel
with
which
his
father
had
inspired
him
i
think
there
was
nothing
worth
the
knowing
about
which
armitage
had
not
accurate
essential
information
books
plays
pictures
music
literature
history
economics
science
medicine
law
finance
he
was
a
good
shot
and
a
good
horseman
could
run
an
automobile
take
it
to
pieces
put
it
together
again
he
was
a
practical
mechanic
and
a
practical
railroad
man
he
had
a
successful
model
farm
it
doesn
t
take
long
to
learn
the
essentials
about
anything
said
he
if
you
will
only
put
your
whole
mind
on
it
and
not
let
up
till
you
ve
got
what
you
want
and
the
trouble
with
most
people
why
they
are
narrow
and
ignorant
and
incompetent
it
isn
t
lack
of
mind
but
lack
of
interest
they
have
no
curiosity
nor
was
my
friend
armitage
a
smatterer
he
didn
t
try
to
do
everything
he
contented
himself
with
knowledge
and
did
only
one
thing
made
money
out
of
railroads
when
he
saw
that
i
really
wished
to
be
educated
he
amused
himself
by
educating
me
not
in
a
formal
way
of
course
but
simply
talking
along
about
whatever
happened
to
come
up
i
have
never
known
a
man
to
get
anywhere
who
did
not
have
an
excellent
memory
lack
of
memory
which
means
lack
of
the
habit
and
power
of
giving
attention
is
the
cause
of
more
failures
than
all
other
defects
put
together
if
you
don
t
believe
it
test
the
failures
you
know
perhaps
you
might
even
test
your
own
not
too
successful
self
i
had
an
unusual
memory
and
i
don
t
think
armitage
or
anyone
ever
told
me
anything
worth
knowing
that
i
did
not
stick
to
it
and
keep
it
where
i
could
use
it
instantly
several
months
after
his
wife
and
mine
departed
we
were
walking
in
the
park
one
afternoon
the
usual
tramp
round
the
upper
reservoir
to
reduce
or
to
keep
in
condition
he
said
in
the
most
casual
way
my
wife
is
coming
next
week
and
will
get
her
divorce
at
once
taking
my
cue
from
his
manner
i
showed
even
less
surprise
then
i
felt
this
is
the
first
i
ve
heard
of
it
said
i
really
said
he
carelessly
everyone
knows
he
laughed
to
himself
she
is
to
marry
lord
blankenship
the
earl
of
blankenship
and
the
children
said
i
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
don
t
know
her
people
will
look
after
them
she
has
spoiled
them
beyond
repair
i
have
no
interest
in
them
nor
they
in
me
after
a
little
tramping
in
silence
he
halted
and
rested
his
hands
on
the
railing
and
looked
away
across
the
lakelike
reservoir
its
surface
tossed
up
into
white
caps
by
the
wind
i
loved
her
when
we
were
married
said
he
that
caused
all
the
mischief
i
let
her
do
as
she
pleased
she
was
a
fine
girl
good
family
but
poor
she
pretended
to
be
in
sympathy
with
my
ideas
his
lip
curled
in
good
humored
contempt
i
believed
in
her
enthusiasm
my
father
wonderfully
sane
old
man
warned
me
she
was
only
after
our
money
but
i
wouldn
t
listen
tried
to
quarrel
with
him
he
wouldn
t
have
it
gave
me
my
way
it
s
not
strange
i
believed
in
her
she
looked
all
that
s
high
minded
and
delicate
and
what
they
call
aristocratic
well
it
is
aristocratic
the
reality
of
aristocracy
perhaps
she
was
sincere
said
i
out
of
the
depths
of
my
own
experience
perhaps
she
honestly
imagined
she
liked
and
wanted
the
sort
of
life
you
pictured
we
are
all
hypocrites
but
most
of
us
are
unconscious
hypocrites
no
doubt
she
did
deceive
herself
in
part
at
least
he
admitted
for
a
year
or
so
after
our
marriage
she
kept
up
the
bluff
i
didn
t
catch
on
didn
t
find
her
out
until
we
began
to
differ
about
bringing
up
the
children
even
then
i
loved
her
so
that
i
let
her
have
her
way
until
it
was
too
late
but
said
i
don
t
you
owe
it
to
them
to
he
interrupted
with
an
impatient
didn
t
i
try
but
it
was
hopeless
to
succeed
in
this
day
i
d
have
had
to
take
the
children
away
off
into
the
woods
with
the
chances
that
even
there
the
servants
i
d
be
compelled
to
have
would
spoil
them
would
keep
them
reminded
of
the
rotten
snobbishness
they
ve
been
taught
he
laughed
at
me
with
mocking
irony
you
have
a
daughter
said
he
what
about
her
i
was
thinking
of
your
boy
said
i
he
frowned
and
looked
away
after
a
long
pause
hopeless
hopeless
said
he
believe
me
hopeless
the
boy
is
like
her
no
i
ll
have
to
begin
all
over
again
i
gave
an
inquiring
look
marry
again
explained
he
another
sort
of
woman
and
keep
her
and
her
children
away
from
this
world
of
ours
i
d
like
to
try
the
experiment
but
he
laughed
apologetically
i
m
afraid
i
love
the
city
and
its
amusements
too
well
i
m
not
as
determined
nor
as
ardent
as
i
once
was
what
does
it
matter
anyway
so
long
as
we
are
comfortable
and
well
amused
why
should
we
bother
after
a
silence
another
mistake
i
made
the
initial
mistake
was
in
giving
her
a
fortune
she
is
almost
as
well
fixed
as
i
am
don
t
make
that
mistake
godfrey
i
ve
already
done
it
said
i
and
i
shall
never
be
sorry
that
i
did
i
gave
my
wife
the
first
large
sum
i
made
and
i
ve
added
to
it
from
time
to
time
i
wanted
her
and
margot
to
be
safe
no
matter
what
happened
to
me
a
mistake
he
said
a
sad
mistake
i
know
how
you
felt
i
felt
the
same
way
but
there
s
something
worse
than
the
more
or
less
sentimental
aversion
to
being
loved
and
considered
merely
for
the
money
they
can
get
out
of
you
and
can
t
get
without
you
nothing
worse
i
declared
yes
he
replied
it
s
worse
to
give
a
foolish
woman
the
power
to
make
a
fool
of
herself
of
her
children
and
of
you
that
is
bad
i
ll
admit
said
i
but
the
other
is
worse
at
least
to
me
you
d
refuse
to
make
a
child
behave
itself
through
the
selfish
fear
that
it
would
hate
you
for
doing
so
i
laughed
you
know
my
weakness
i
see
said
i
there
s
the
foolish
american
husband
and
father
no
wonder
all
the
classes
that
ought
to
be
leaders
in
development
and
civilization
are
leaders
only
in
luxury
and
folly
oh
let
them
have
a
good
time
what
they
call
a
good
time
said
i
as
you
said
a
moment
ago
it
doesn
t
matter
if
it
only
were
a
good
time
to
be
ignorant
and
snobbish
and
lazy
to
drive
instead
of
walking
to
eat
and
drink
instead
of
thinking
to
be
waited
upon
instead
of
getting
the
education
and
the
happiness
that
come
from
serving
others
don
t
laugh
at
me
after
all
while
you
and
i
all
our
sort
of
men
are
greedy
selfish
grabbers
making
thousands
work
for
us
still
we
do
build
up
big
enterprises
we
do
set
things
to
moving
and
we
do
teach
men
the
discipline
of
regular
work
by
forcing
them
to
work
for
us
at
more
or
less
useful
things
no
doubt
you
gentle
reader
have
fallen
asleep
over
this
conversation
i
understand
perfectly
that
it
is
beyond
you
for
you
have
no
conception
of
the
deep
underlying
principles
of
the
relations
of
men
and
men
or
men
and
women
but
there
may
be
among
my
readers
a
few
who
will
see
interest
and
importance
in
this
talk
with
armitage
it
is
time
the
writers
of
stories
concerned
themselves
with
the
realities
of
life
instead
of
with
the
showy
and
sensational
things
that
obscure
or
hide
the
realities
what
would
you
think
of
the
physiologist
who
issued
a
treatise
on
physiology
with
no
mention
or
account
of
the
blood
yet
you
read
stories
about
what
purports
to
be
life
with
no
mention
or
account
of
money
this
when
in
any
society
money
is
the
all
important
factor
put
aside
if
you
can
the
prejudices
of
your
miseducation
and
sthetics
of
your
false
culture
and
your
false
refinement
open
your
mind
think
and
you
will
see
that
i
am
right
when
we
were
well
down
toward
the
end
of
the
park
armitage
said
pardon
me
a
direct
question
have
you
and
your
wife
separated
no
said
i
she
has
gone
abroad
to
round
out
margot
s
education
and
her
own
you
know
what
that
means
in
a
general
way
replied
i
i
m
letting
them
amuse
themselves
they
don
t
need
me
nor
i
them
perhaps
when
they
come
back
i
did
not
finish
my
sentence
he
laughed
that
means
you
don
t
really
care
what
happens
when
they
come
back
my
smile
was
an
admission
of
the
correctness
of
his
guess
we
dropped
our
domestic
affairs
and
took
up
the
matters
that
were
more
interesting
and
more
important
to
us
if
you
have
good
sight
unimpaired
eyes
you
go
about
assuming
when
you
think
of
it
at
all
that
good
sight
is
the
rule
in
the
world
and
impaired
eyes
the
exception
but
let
your
sight
begin
to
fail
let
your
eyes
become
darkened
and
soon
you
discover
that
you
are
one
of
thousands
that
good
sight
is
the
exception
that
almost
everyone
has
something
the
matter
with
his
eyes
the
reason
human
beings
know
so
little
about
human
nature
the
reason
the
sentimental
flapdoodle
about
human
virtues
in
the
present
not
very
far
advanced
stage
of
human
evolution
is
so
widely
believed
and
doubt
of
it
so
indignantly
denounced
as
cynicism
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
average
human
being
is
ignorant
of
the
afflictions
of
his
own
soul
this
would
be
pleasant
and
harmless
enough
and
to
destroy
the
delusion
would
be
wickedly
cruel
were
it
not
that
the
only
way
to
cure
ailments
of
whatever
sort
is
to
diagnose
them
what
hope
is
there
for
the
man
devoured
of
a
fever
who
fancies
and
insists
that
he
is
healthy
what
hope
is
there
for
the
man
who
eats
pleasant
tasting
slow
poison
under
the
impression
that
it
is
food
what
a
quaint
notion
it
is
that
the
truth
the
sole
source
of
health
and
happiness
is
bad
for
some
people
chiefly
for
those
sick
unto
death
through
the
falsehoods
of
ignorance
and
vanity
we
humans
are
like
the
animal
that
claws
and
bites
the
surgeon
who
is
trying
to
set
its
broken
leg
but
i
am
wandering
a
little
discover
that
you
have
any
ailment
of
body
or
of
soul
and
you
soon
discover
how
widespread
that
ailment
is
you
do
not
even
appreciate
how
widespread
incessant
and
poignant
are
the
ravages
of
death
until
your
own
family
and
friends
begin
to
die
off
i
had
no
notion
of
the
extent
of
the
social
or
domestic
malady
of
abandoned
husbands
and
fathers
until
i
became
one
of
that
curious
class
among
the
masses
there
is
the
great
and
growing
pestilence
of
abandoned
wives
husbands
worn
out
by
the
uncertainties
of
the
laboring
man
s
income
and
disgusted
with
the
incompetence
of
their
wives
and
with
the
exasperations
of
the
badly
brought
up
children
such
husbands
flying
by
tens
of
thousands
to
escape
what
they
cannot
cure
or
endure
among
the
classes
from
the
plutocracy
down
to
and
through
the
small
merchants
and
professional
men
i
now
discovered
that
there
was
a
corresponding
and
reversed
disease
the
abandoned
husband
the
husband
and
father
working
hard
and
presently
accumulating
enough
for
ease
in
his
particular
station
of
life
suddenly
finds
himself
supporting
with
perhaps
all
the
money
he
can
scrape
together
a
distant
and
completely
detached
family
he
mails
his
money
regularly
and
with
a
fidelity
that
will
appear
grotesque
noble
or
pitiful
according
to
the
point
of
view
in
return
he
gets
occasional
letters
from
the
loved
ones
perfunctory
these
letters
somehow
sound
or
would
sound
to
the
critical
though
they
are
liberally
sprinkled
with
loving
even
fawning
phrases
such
as
dear
sweet
papa
and
darling
husband
where
are
the
loved
ones
if
the
family
home
is
in
a
small
town
or
country
they
are
in
new
york
or
some
other
city
of
america
usually
if
the
family
home
is
in
the
city
they
are
abroad
what
are
they
doing
sacrificing
themselves
especially
poor
wife
and
mother
she
would
infinitely
prefer
being
at
home
with
beloved
husband
but
she
must
not
be
selfish
she
must
carry
her
part
of
their
common
burden
while
he
toils
to
provide
for
the
children
she
toils
in
the
loneliness
or
unhappiness
of
new
york
or
paris
or
rome
or
dresden
or
genoa
and
what
is
she
toiling
at
in
those
desert
places
why
at
educating
the
children
sometimes
it
s
music
sometimes
it
s
painting
again
it
s
finishing
whatever
that
may
mean
or
plain
vague
education
there
was
a
time
when
men
of
any
sort
could
be
instantly
abashed
silenced
and
abased
by
the
mere
pronouncing
of
the
word
education
that
happy
day
for
mental
fakers
is
nearing
its
close
now
at
the
sound
of
the
sacred
word
many
a
sensible
practical
man
has
the
courage
to
put
on
a
grin
i
have
been
credited
with
saying
that
a
revival
of
the
declining
child
bearing
among
american
women
might
be
looked
for
now
that
they
have
found
the
usefulness
of
children
as
an
excuse
for
escape
from
home
and
husband
i
admit
having
said
this
but
i
meant
it
as
a
jest
however
there
is
truth
in
the
jest
i
don
t
especially
blame
the
women
why
should
they
stay
at
home
when
they
have
no
sympathy
with
the
things
that
necessarily
engross
the
husband
why
stay
at
home
when
it
bores
them
even
to
see
that
the
servants
carry
on
the
house
decently
why
stay
at
home
when
they
simply
show
there
from
day
to
day
how
little
they
know
about
housekeeping
why
stay
at
home
when
there
is
an
amiable
fool
willing
to
mail
them
his
money
while
they
amuse
themselves
gadding
about
europe
or
some
big
city
of
america
abandoned
wives
at
the
one
end
of
the
social
scale
abandoned
husbands
at
the
other
end
please
note
that
in
both
cases
the
deep
underlying
cause
is
the
same
money
too
little
money
and
the
husband
flies
too
much
money
and
it
is
the
wife
who
breaks
up
the
family
as
soon
as
i
discovered
by
being
elected
to
membership
the
existence
of
the
universal
order
of
abandoned
husbands
i
took
the
liveliest
interest
in
it
i
was
eager
to
learn
whether
there
was
another
fool
quite
so
foolish
as
myself
also
whether
the
other
fools
were
aware
of
their
own
folly
i
found
that
most
of
them
were
rather
proud
of
their
membership
indulged
in
a
ludicrous
cocking
of
the
comb
and
waggling
of
the
wattles
when
they
spoke
of
my
family
over
on
the
other
side
for
a
few
years
or
of
my
wife
poor
woman
exiled
in
paris
to
cultivate
my
daughter
s
voice
or
of
my
invalid
wife
she
has
to
live
in
the
south
of
france
it
s
a
sad
trial
to
us
both
then
but
this
came
much
later
i
discovered
that
these
credulous
money
mailing
fools
including
myself
were
not
quite
so
imbecile
as
a
class
as
they
seemed
to
be
i
discovered
that
they
were
secretly
often
unconsciously
glad
to
be
rid
of
their
uncongenial
families
and
regarded
any
money
they
mailed
as
money
well
spent
they
toiled
cheerfully
at
distasteful
tasks
to
get
the
wherewithal
to
keep
their
loved
ones
far
far
away
the
absence
of
edna
and
margot
was
an
enormous
relief
to
me
edna
was
constantly
annoying
me
to
accompanying
her
to
places
to
which
i
did
not
care
to
go
i
like
the
theatre
and
i
rather
like
some
operas
but
when
i
go
to
either
it
is
for
the
sake
of
the
performance
going
with
edna
and
her
friends
meant
a
tedious
social
function
we
arrived
late
we
did
not
hear
the
play
or
the
opera
as
for
the
purely
social
functions
they
were
intolerable
perhaps
i
should
not
have
been
so
unhappy
had
i
been
the
kind
of
man
who
likes
to
talk
for
the
sake
of
hearing
his
own
voice
women
are
attentive
listeners
when
the
man
who
is
talking
is
worth
flattering
but
i
talk
only
for
purpose
and
when
i
listen
i
wish
it
to
be
to
some
purpose
also
so
edna
always
urging
me
to
do
something
distasteful
or
giving
me
the
sense
that
she
was
about
to
ask
me
or
was
irritated
against
me
for
being
disobliging
edna
made
me
uncomfortable
increasingly
uncomfortable
as
i
grew
more
intelligent
more
critical
more
discriminating
as
for
margot
i
could
not
talk
with
her
ten
minutes
without
seeing
protrude
from
her
sweet
loveliness
some
vulgarity
of
snobbishness
it
irritated
me
to
hear
her
speak
to
a
servant
i
had
to
rebuke
her
privately
several
times
for
the
tone
she
used
in
addressing
her
governess
or
my
secretary
this
when
her
mother
and
all
her
mother
s
friends
used
precisely
the
same
repellent
gracious
tone
in
the
same
circumstances
i
saw
that
she
sometimes
instinctively
again
deliberately
tried
to
hide
her
real
self
from
me
that
i
was
making
a
hypocrite
of
her
any
sort
of
frankness
or
sympathy
between
her
and
me
was
impossible
a
few
weeks
after
their
departure
i
closed
the
house
it
came
to
me
that
i
need
endure
its
discomforts
no
longer
that
i
could
get
rid
of
those
smelly
dull
witted
low
minded
foreign
animals
that
i
need
not
endure
food
sent
up
from
a
kitchen
as
to
which
i
had
from
time
to
time
disgusting
proofs
that
it
was
not
clean
i
closed
the
house
and
left
the
mice
and
roaches
and
other
insects
to
such
short
provender
as
would
be
provided
by
caretaker
and
family
i
took
an
apartment
in
a
first
class
hotel
when
armitage
got
clear
of
his
wife
he
took
the
adjoining
apartment
and
how
comfortable
and
how
cheerful
we
were
the
women
with
their
incompetence
and
indifference
have
about
destroyed
the
american
home
to
get
good
service
to
have
capable
people
assisting
you
you
must
yourself
be
capable
the
incapacity
of
the
ladies
has
driven
good
servants
out
of
the
business
of
domestic
service
has
left
in
it
only
the
worthless
and
unreliable
creatures
who
now
take
care
of
the
homes
if
you
find
any
part
of
the
laboring
class
deteriorating
don
t
blame
them
to
do
that
is
to
get
nowhere
is
to
be
unjust
and
shallow
to
boot
instead
look
at
the
employers
of
that
labor
every
time
you
will
find
the
fault
is
there
just
as
an
ill
mannered
or
a
bad
child
means
unfaithful
parents
the
masses
of
mankind
must
have
leadership
guidance
example
my
experience
has
been
that
they
respond
when
the
dominating
classes
do
their
duty
that
is
pay
proper
wages
demand
good
service
and
know
what
good
service
is
what
a
relief
and
a
joy
that
hotel
was
armitage
and
i
had
our
own
cook
and
so
could
have
the
simple
dishes
we
liked
we
attended
to
the
marketing
and
both
knew
what
sort
of
meat
and
vegetables
and
fruit
to
buy
and
were
not
long
trifled
with
by
our
butcher
our
grocer
and
our
dairyman
spoiled
though
they
were
by
the
ladies
and
our
apartments
were
clean
really
clean
and
after
the
first
few
weeks
our
servants
were
contented
and
abandoned
the
evil
ways
slip
shod
mistresses
had
got
them
into
pushing
my
inquiries
i
found
that
not
only
our
hotel
but
every
first
class
hotel
in
the
fashionable
district
was
filled
with
the
remnants
of
shattered
homes
husbands
who
had
compelled
their
wives
to
give
up
the
expensive
and
dirty
attempts
at
housekeeping
husbands
who
had
abandoned
their
families
in
country
homes
or
in
other
cities
and
towns
and
had
surreptitiously
or
boldly
returned
to
bachelor
bliss
husbands
who
had
been
abandoned
by
their
families
none
of
these
last
cases
being
more
heart
breaking
than
armitage
s
or
my
own
the
story
ran
that
he
was
on
the
verge
of
melancholia
because
his
beautiful
wife
had
cast
him
off
there
was
no
more
truth
in
this
than
there
would
have
been
in
a
tale
of
my
lonely
grief
had
it
not
been
for
armitage
pointing
out
to
me
the
truth
i
might
have
fancied
myself
a
deserted
unfortunate
it
would
not
have
been
an
isolated
instance
of
a
human
being
not
knowing
when
he
is
well
off
i
did
not
see
my
family
again
until
the
following
spring
business
compelled
me
to
go
abroad
and
they
had
come
over
to
london
for
the
season
when
i
descended
from
the
train
at
euston
a
little
confused
by
the
strangeness
i
saw
my
wife
a
few
yards
down
the
platform
beside
her
stood
a
tall
beautiful
young
woman
whom
i
did
not
instantly
recognize
as
my
daughter
both
were
dressed
with
the
perfection
of
taste
and
of
detail
that
has
made
the
american
woman
famous
throughout
the
world
i
like
well
dressed
women
and
well
dressed
men
too
i
should
certainly
have
been
convicted
of
poor
taste
had
i
not
been
dazzled
by
those
two
charming
examples
of
fashion
and
style
they
looked
like
two
lovely
sisters
the
elder
not
more
than
five
or
six
years
in
advance
of
the
younger
i
was
a
youthful
looking
man
myself
except
perhaps
when
i
was
in
the
midst
of
affairs
and
took
on
the
air
of
responsibility
that
cannot
appear
in
the
face
of
youth
but
no
one
would
have
believed
there
were
so
few
years
between
edna
and
me
nor
was
she
in
the
least
made
up
the
youth
was
genuinely
there
that
meeting
must
have
impressed
the
by
standers
who
were
observing
the
two
women
with
admiring
interest
i
felt
a
glow
of
enthusiasm
at
sight
of
these
elegant
beauties
i
was
proud
to
be
able
to
claim
them
as
for
them
they
became
radiant
the
instant
they
saw
me
godfrey
cried
edna
loudly
rushing
toward
me
papa
dear
old
papa
cried
margot
waving
her
arms
in
a
pretty
gesture
of
impatient
adoration
while
her
mother
was
detaining
me
from
her
embrace
well
well
cried
i
what
a
pair
of
girls
my
but
you
re
tearing
it
off
they
laughed
gayly
and
hugged
and
kissed
me
all
over
again
for
a
moment
i
felt
that
i
had
been
missed
and
that
i
had
missed
them
a
good
looking
shortish
and
shy
young
man
dressed
and
groomed
in
the
attractive
english
upper
class
way
of
exquisiteness
with
no
sacrifice
of
manliness
was
now
brought
forward
lord
crossley
my
husband
said
edna
pleased
i
m
sure
murmured
the
young
man
giving
me
his
hand
with
an
awkwardness
that
was
somehow
not
awkward
or
rather
that
conveyed
a
subtle
impression
of
good
breeding
now
that
you
ve
got
him
or
that
he
s
got
you
proceeded
he
i
ll
toddle
along
my
wife
gave
him
her
hand
carelessly
until
dinner
she
said
margot
shook
hands
with
him
and
nodded
and
smiled
when
he
was
gone
i
observed
the
carriage
near
which
we
were
standing
and
i
knew
at
once
that
it
was
my
wife
s
carriage
it
was
a
grand
car
of
state
yet
quiet
and
simple
i
often
looked
at
it
afterwards
trying
to
puzzle
out
how
it
contrived
to
convey
two
exactly
opposite
impressions
i
could
never
solve
the
mystery
on
the
lofty
box
sat
the
most
perfect
model
of
a
coachman
i
had
seen
up
to
that
time
beside
the
open
door
in
the
shallow
loftily
hung
body
of
the
carriage
stood
an
equally
perfect
footman
i
was
soon
to
get
used
to
that
marvelous
english
ability
at
specializing
men
a
system
by
which
a
man
intended
for
a
certain
career
is
arrested
in
every
other
kind
of
growth
except
only
that
which
tends
to
make
him
more
perfect
for
his
purpose
observing
an
english
coachman
or
valet
or
butler
or
what
not
you
say
here
is
a
remarkably
clever
man
yet
you
soon
find
out
that
he
is
practically
imbecile
in
every
other
respect
but
his
specialty
we
entered
the
carriage
i
sitting
opposite
the
ladies
and
most
uncomfortable
i
was
for
the
carriage
was
designed
to
show
off
its
occupants
and
to
look
well
in
it
they
had
to
know
precisely
how
to
sit
which
i
did
not
no
one
noticed
me
however
there
was
too
much
pleasure
to
be
got
out
of
observing
edna
and
margot
who
were
looking
like
duchesses
out
of
a
storybook
i
knew
they
were
delightfully
conscious
of
the
sensation
they
were
making
yet
they
talked
and
laughed
as
if
they
were
alone
in
their
own
sitting
room
a
trick
which
is
part
of
that
education
of
which
you
have
heard
something
and
will
hear
still
more
the
conversation
seemed
easy
in
fact
it
was
only
animated
it
was
a
fair
specimen
of
that
whole
mode
of
life
you
have
seen
the
wonderful
peaches
that
come
to
new
york
from
south
africa
early
in
the
winter
have
delighted
in
their
exquisite
perfection
of
color
and
form
but
have
you
ever
tasted
them
i
would
as
lief
eat
sawdust
i
would
rather
eat
it
for
of
sawdust
i
should
expect
nothing
that
young
man
is
the
marquis
of
crossley
said
my
wife
i
liked
to
hear
her
pronounce
a
title
in
private
it
gave
you
the
sense
of
something
that
tasted
fine
made
you
envy
her
the
sensation
she
was
getting
who
is
he
said
i
margot
laughed
na
vely
an
entrancing
display
of
white
teeth
and
rose
lined
mouth
marquis
of
crossley
papa
she
said
that
s
all
and
quite
enough
it
is
i
don
t
know
much
about
the
big
men
in
england
said
i
he
looked
rather
young
to
amount
to
very
much
he
s
as
old
as
you
are
said
edna
a
flash
of
ill
humor
appearing
and
vanishing
i
was
astonished
i
thought
him
a
boy
said
i
he
s
one
of
the
greatest
nobles
in
england
one
of
the
greatest
in
europe
said
edna
and
i
saw
margot
s
eyes
sparkling
he
seemed
a
nice
fellow
said
i
amiably
how
you
have
grown
margot
hasn
t
she
though
cried
my
wife
aren
t
you
proud
of
her
i
m
proud
of
you
both
said
i
you
make
me
feel
old
and
dingy
you
ve
been
working
too
hard
poor
dear
said
edna
tenderly
if
you
only
would
stay
over
here
and
learn
the
art
of
leisure
i
m
afraid
i
d
be
dismally
bored
said
i
i
had
heard
much
about
the
art
of
loafing
as
practiced
by
europeans
and
i
had
not
been
attracted
by
what
i
had
heard
it
was
inconceivable
to
me
that
intelligent
grown
men
could
pass
their
time
at
things
about
equal
to
marbles
and
tops
but
i
suppose
i
am
abnormal
as
they
allege
many
men
seem
to
look
on
mental
effort
of
any
kind
as
toilsome
and
seize
the
first
opportunity
to
return
to
the
mindless
frolickings
of
the
beasts
of
the
field
to
me
mental
effort
is
a
keen
pleasure
and
i
must
add
i
can
t
help
thinking
it
is
to
everybody
who
has
real
brains
the
conversation
would
have
died
in
distressing
agony
had
it
not
been
for
the
indomitable
pluck
of
my
wife
she
struggled
desperately
perhaps
may
even
have
deceived
herself
into
thinking
that
she
was
glad
to
see
me
and
that
the
carriage
was
the
scene
of
a
happy
reunion
but
i
who
had
a
thorough
training
in
quickly
sizing
up
situations
saw
the
truth
that
i
was
a
rank
outsider
to
both
wife
and
daughter
that
they
were
strangers
to
me
i
began
to
debate
what
was
the
shortest
time
i
could
decently
stop
in
london
we
are
to
be
presented
at
court
next
week
said
edna
margot
s
eyes
were
again
sparkling
it
was
the
sort
of
look
the
novelists
put
on
the
sweet
young
girl
s
face
when
she
sees
her
lover
coming
yes
next
week
next
thursday
said
edna
and
so
another
of
the
little
duchess
s
dreams
is
coming
true
is
it
exciting
said
i
to
margot
somehow
reference
to
the
little
duchess
irritated
me
rather
exclaimed
margot
fairly
glowing
with
ecstasy
you
put
on
the
most
wonderful
dress
and
you
drive
in
a
long
long
line
of
wonderful
carriages
with
all
the
women
in
wonderful
dresses
and
you
go
into
the
palace
through
lines
and
lines
of
gorgeous
liveries
and
uniforms
and
you
wait
in
a
huge
grand
room
for
an
hour
or
so
frightened
to
death
and
then
you
walk
into
the
next
room
and
make
the
courtesy
you
have
been
practicing
for
weeks
and
you
pass
on
good
cried
i
what
then
why
you
go
home
half
dead
from
the
nervous
shock
oh
it
s
wonderful
it
seemed
to
me
for
i
was
becoming
somewhat
critical
as
is
the
habit
in
moods
of
irritation
it
seemed
to
me
that
margot
s
elaborate
and
costly
education
might
have
included
the
acquiring
of
a
more
extensive
vocabulary
that
word
wonderful
was
beginning
to
get
on
my
nerves
still
this
was
hyper
criticism
a
lovely
woman
does
not
need
a
vocabulary
or
anything
else
but
a
lovely
dress
and
plenty
of
money
to
provide
background
yes
it
must
be
wonderful
said
i
we
ve
been
working
at
it
for
weeks
mamma
and
i
continued
she
i
m
sure
we
shall
do
well
i
can
hardly
wait
just
fancy
i
m
to
meet
the
king
and
the
queen
i
saw
that
edna
was
in
the
same
ecstatic
trance
i
leaned
back
and
tried
to
distract
myself
with
the
novelty
of
london
houses
and
crowds
it
may
be
you
understand
the
mingling
of
pity
contempt
anger
and
amusement
that
filled
my
breast
if
you
do
not
understand
explanation
would
merely
weary
you
i
was
no
longer
proud
of
my
beautiful
family
i
wished
to
get
away
from

them
edna
and
margot
chatted
on
and
on
about
the
king
and
queen
about
the
various
titled
people
they
knew
or
hoped
to
know
about
the
thrills
of
aristocratic
society
i
tried
not
to
listen
after
a
while
i
said
with
i
hope
not
unsuccessful
attempt
at
amiability
i
m
sorry
i
shan
t
be
here
to
witness
your
triumph
across
edna
s
face
swept
a
flash
of
vivid
i
had
almost
said
vicious
annoyance
you
re
not
going
before
the
drawing
room
at
buckingham
palace
cried
she
i
ll
have
to
said
i
but
you
can
t
protested
margot
tears
of
vexation
in
her
eyes
everyone
will
think
it
s
dreadfully
queer
don
t
fret
about
that
my
dear
replied
i
lightly
i
know
how
it
is
over
here
so
long
as
you
ve
got
the
cash
they
ll
never
ask
a
question
we
americans
mean
money
to
them
and
that
s
all
oh
papa
cried
margot
don
t
put
such
ideas
into
the
child
s
head
godfrey
said
my
wife
restraining
herself
in
a
most
ladylike
manner
she
knows
said
i
so
do
you
money
is
everything
with
aristocracies
everywhere
they
must
live
luxuriously
without
work
that
can
t
be
done
without
money
lots
of
money
so
aristocrats
seriously
think
of
nothing
else
whatever
they
may
talk
you
ll
have
a
better
opinion
of
them
when
you
know
them
said
edna
once
more
serene
and
sweetly
friendly
i
don
t
think
badly
of
them
i
replied
i
admire
their
cleverness
but
you
mustn
t
ask
me
to
respect
them
they
hardly
expect
it
they
don
t
respect
themselves
if
they
did
they
d
not
be
stealing
but
working
margot
listened
with
lowered
eyes
i
saw
that
she
was
ashamed
of
and
for
me
edna
concealed
her
feelings
better
she
forced
an
amiable
smile
i
don
t
know
much
about
these
things
she
said
politely
but
godfrey
you
mustn
t
desert
us
at
least
not
until
after
the
drawing
room
i
ve
told
our
ambassador
you
re
to
be
here
and
he
has
gone
to
no
end
of
trouble
to
arrange
for
you
howard
said
i
that
pup
i
despise
him
he
s
a
rotten
old
snob
they
tell
me
his
toadyism
turns
the
stomach
of
even
the
english
he
s
a
disgrace
to
our
country
but
i
suppose
he
s
little
if
any
worse
than
most
of
our
ambassadors
over
here
they
ve
all
bought
their
jobs
to
gratify
their
own
and
their
wives
taste
for
shoe
polish
this
speech
so
depressed
the
ladies
that
their
last
remnant
of
vivacity
fled
not
to
return
you
are
sympathizing
with
them
gentle
reader
and
they
are
welcome
to
your
sympathy
we
drove
in
silence
the
rest
of
the
way
to
the
hotel
in
piccadilly
where
they
were
installed
in
pompous
luxury
and
had
made
equally
luxurious
provision
for
me
when
i
was
alone
with
my
valet
i
reasoned
myself
out
of
the
grouchy
mood
into
which
the
evidences
of
my
family
s
fresh
access
of
folly
had
thrown
me
to
quarrel
with
them
to
be
irritated
against
them
was
about
as
unreasonable
as
attacking
a
black
man
for
not
being
white
i
had
long
since
realized
as
the
result
of
much
experience
and
reflection
that
character
is
no
more
to
be
changed
than
any
other
inborn
quality
my
wife
had
been
born
an
aristocrat
and
had
brought
into
the
world
an
aristocratic
daughter
she
was
to
be
blamed
neither
for
the
one
thing
nor
for
the
other
and
it
ill
became
my
pretensions
to
superior
intellect
to
gird
at
her
and
at
margot
the
thing
for
me
to
do
was
to
let
them
alone
keep
away
at
dinner
which
was
served
in
our
apartment
i
took
a
different
tone
with
them
and
they
met
me
more
than
half
way
so
cheered
was
my
lovely
daughter
that
after
dinner
she
perched
on
the
arm
of
my
chair
and
ventured
to
bring
up
the
dangerous
subject
said
she
you
re
not
going
to
be
mean
to
me
and
run
away
are
you
papa
looking
at
edna
but
addressing
margot
i
replied
your
mother
will
tell
you
that
it
s
best
we
three
never
can
agree
in
our
ideas
of
things
i
m
an
irritation
i
spoil
your
pleasure
no
no
indeed
cried
the
girl
i
ve
been
looking
forward
to
your
coming
i
ve
been
telling
everybody
how
handsome
and
superior
you
are
and
i
want
them
to
see
for
themselves
most
pleasant
to
hear
from
such
rare
prettiness
and
most
sincerely
spoken
so
many
of
the
american
men
in
society
over
here
are
common
proceeded
she
and
even
those
who
aren
t
so
very
common
somehow
seem
so
they
are
down
on
their
knees
before
titles
and
they
act
like
servants
even
mr
howard
he
oughtn
t
to
show
his
feelings
so
plainly
of
course
we
all
feel
impressed
and
honored
by
being
taken
up
by
real
titled
people
of
old
families
but
it
s
such
bad
form
to
show
and
it
interferes
with
getting
on
when
i
m
talking
to
lord
crossley
about
that
drawing
room
i
act
as
if
it
were
nothing
i
see
you
are
being
well
educated
said
i
laughing
oh
yes
mamma
and
i
have
worked
we
ve
not
had
an
idle
moment
i
believe
you
said
i
you
will
stay
papa
won
t
you
i
shook
my
head
but
it
was
no
longer
the
positive
gesture
my
besetting
sin
my
good
nature
had
possession
of
me
remember
it
was
after
dinner
and
my
beautiful
daughter
was
caressing
my
cheek
and
was
pleading
in
a
voice
whose
modulations
had
been
cultivated
by
the
best
masters
in
paris
but
i
don
t
want
people
to
think
i
was
deceiving
them
about
my
papa
i
m
willing
to
be
exhibited
to
a
select
few
in
the
next
two
or
three
days
i
conceded
they
will
tell
the
others
and
with
that
they
had
to
be
content
in
the
faint
hope
of
inducing
me
to
change
my
mind
edna
the
devoid
of
the
sense
of
humor
took
me
to
a
tailor
s
and
had
me
shown
pictures
and
models
of
the
court
costume
i
would
wear
but
i
remained
firm
a
sense
of
humor
would
have
warned
her
that
a
person
of
my
sort
would
have
an
aversion
to
liveries
of
every
kind
to
any
costume
that
stamps
a
man
as
one
of
a
class
i
am
perhaps
foolishly
jealous
of
my
own
individuality
but
i
cannot
help
it
a
king
in
his
robes
a
general
in
his
uniform
except
in
battle
where
it
s
as
necessary
and
useful
as
night
shirt
or
pajamas
in
bed
any
sort
of
livery
seems
pitiful
and
contemptible
to
me
i
will
wear
the
distinguishing
dress
of
the
human
race
and
the
male
sex
but
further
than
that
classification
i
refuse
to
move
also
what
business
had
i
citizen
of
a
democracy
whose
chief
idea
is
the
barbarism
and
silliness
of
aristocracy
what
business
had
i
going
to
see
a
king
and
a
queen
i
should
have
felt
that
i
was
aiding
them
in
the
triumph
of
dragging
democracy
at
their
chariot
wheels
no
i
would
not
go
to
levees
and
drawing
rooms
you
may
say
i
showed
myself
an
absurd
extremist
well
perhaps
so
but
as
it
seems
to
be
necessary
to
go
to
one
extreme
or
the
other
i
prefer
the
extreme
of
exaggerated
and
vainglorious
self
respect
the
king
and
queen
are
no
doubt
nice
people
said
i
to
margot
but
if
i
meet
them
it
must
be
on
terms
of
equality
and
for
some
purpose
less
inane
than
exchanging
a
few
set
phrases
edna
and
margot
seemed
to
feel
that
they
had
on
the
whole
a
presentable
specimen
of
male
relative
to
exhibit
for
they
made
the
most
of
the
four
days
i
gave
them
through
hilda
armitage
now
lady
blankenship
and
much
freshened
up
by
the
more
congenial
atmosphere
they
had
got
in
with
the
set
that
is
the
least
easy
of
access
to
americans
though
of
course
it
is
not
actually
difficult
for
any
american
with
plenty
of
money
and
a
willingness
to
spend
and
good
guidance
in
how
to
spend
and
i
must
admit
i
enjoyed
myself
in
those
four
days
the
women
were
for
the
most
part
rather
slow
though
i
recall
two
who
had
real
intelligence
and
i
don
t
think
there
was
a
single
one
quite
so
devoid
of
knowledge
of
important
subjects
as
our
boasted
bright
american
women
the
men
were
distinctly
attractive
they
had
information
they
had
breadth
the
thing
the
upper
class
men
of
america
often
lack
also
they
were
entirely
free
from
that
ill
at
easeness
about
their
own
and
their
neighbor
s
position
in
society
which
makes
the
american
upper
classes
tiresome
and
ridiculous
it
amused
me
to
observe
the
americans
in
this
environment
both
our
women
and
our
men
seemed
uneasy
small
pinched
you
could
distinguish
the
american
man
instantly
by
his
pinched
tight
expression
of
an
upper
servant
out
for
a
holiday
i
could
feel
the
same
thing
in
our
women
but
i
doubt
not
their
looks
and
dress
and
vivacity
concealed
it
from
the
englishmen
anyhow
women
are
used
to
being
nothing
in
themselves
to
taking
rank
and
form
from
their
surroundings
while
with
us
it
seems
to
be
true
that
the
women
are
wholly
responsible
for
social
position
with
all
its
nonsense
the
deeper
truth
is
that
they
owe
everything
to
the
possessions
of
their
fathers
or
husbands
without
that
backing
they
would
be
nothing
everything
must
ultimately
rest
upon
a
substantiality
in
themselves
unsupported
the
women
s
swollen
pretensions
would
vanish
into
thin
air
lord
crossley
was
to
have
dined
with
us
my
first
evening
in
london
but
was
prevented
by
suddenly
arising
business
in
the
country
next
day
he
came
to
lunch
and
i
at
once
saw
that
he
was
after
margot
hammer
and
tongs
i
discovered
it
not
by
the
way
he
treated
her
but
by
his
attitude
toward
her
mother
and
me
he
seemed
a
thoroughly
satisfactory
young
man
in
every
way
and
i
especially
liked
his
frankness
and
simplicity
edna
had
devoted
a
large
part
of
a
long
sight
seeing
tour
with
me
to
an
account
of
his
grandeur
in
the
british
aristocracy
having
had
experience
at
that
time
of
the
american
brand
of
aristocracy
only
i
was
ignorant
of
the
european
kinds
that
have
the
aristocratic
instinct
in
the
most
acute
form
the
ingrowing
form
i
know
now
that
our
own
sort
unpleasant
and
unsightly
though
it
is
cannot
compare
in
malignance
in
littleness
and
meanness
of
soul
with
the
european
sort
just
as
the
noisy
blowhard
is
a
modest
fellow
and
harmless
and
on
acquaintance
lovable
in
comparison
with
the
silent
brooding
egotist
just
so
is
the
american
aristocrat
in
comparison
with
the
european
an
american
aristocrat
has
been
known
to
forget
himself
and
be
human
i
recall
no
instance
of
that
sort
in
an
european
born
and
bred
to
the
notion
that
his
flesh
and
blood
are
of
a
subtler
material
than
the
flesh
and
blood
of
most
men
however
as
i
was
saying
at
the
time
of
my
first
visit
to
europe
i
knew
nothing
of
these
matters
and
lord
crossley
seemed
to
me
a
simple
ingenuous
young
man
most
attractively
boyish
for
his
years
that
chap
wants
to
marry
margot
said
i
to
edna
when
we
were
alone
later
in
the
afternoon
i
think
so
said
she
several
young
men
wish
to
marry
her
but
she
is
in
no
hurry
she
s
not
nineteen
yet
and
she
would
like
a
duke
to
be
sure
said
i
but
she
may
not
be
able
to
love
a
duke
i
never
heard
of
a
girl
who
wouldn
t
love
a
duke
if
she
got
the
chance
said
edna
there
are
only
five
english
dukes
i
mean
who
are
eligible
margot
has
met
three
of
them
and
one
the
duke
of
brestwell
has
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
her
carelessly
but
with
nervous
anxiety
underneath
you
wouldn
t
have
any
objection
i
why
oh
you
are
so
so
peculiar
in
some
ways
anyone
who
pleases
margot
will
suit
me
said
i
we
were
afraid
you
d
be
prejudiced
against
titles
you
ve
been
with
that
eccentric
mr
armitage
so
much
and
you
always
have
been
against
the
sort
of
things
margot
and
i
like
i
ve
no
objection
to
titles
said
i
in
fact
i
think
margot
will
be
happier
if
she
marries
a
title
you
ve
educated
her
so
well
that
she
ll
never
see
the
man
or
think
of
him
how
little
you
know
her
cried
edna
pathetically
and
how
unjust
to
me
your
prejudices
make
you
i
ve
brought
her
up
to
be
all
refinement
all
sentiment
all
heart
she
looks
only
at
the
highest
and
best
at
the
duke
said
i
certainly
at
the
duke
said
she
her
tastes
are
for
the
life
where
a
woman
can
show
her
beauty
of
soul
to
the
best
advantage
and
can
do
the
most
good
there
is
no
career
for
a
woman
in
america
but
over
here
a
woman
married
into
the
aristocracy
has
a
real
career
at
what
said
i
as
a
recognized
social
leader
as
a
leader
in
charities
and
all
sorts
of
good
movements
ah
i
see
said
i
and
there
i
stopped
for
i
had
learned
not
to
argue
with
my
wife
or
with
anyone
else
male
or
female
when
the
subject
is
sheer
twaddle
yes
i
think
margot
would
do
well
to
marry
over
here
and
to
have
a
dazzling
career
i
m
sure
she
d
never
get
tired
of
this
pardon
me
treadmill
i
observe
that
it
s
better
organized
than
the
imitation
one
we
have
over
in
the
states
i
should
say
cried
edna
you
ve
no
idea
how
cheap
and
common
the
best
you
have
in
new
york
is
beside
the
social
life
here
i
ve
been
here
only
a
year
but
already
there
have
been
the
greatest
changes
in
me
don
t
you
notice
i
do
said
i
and
i
can
honestly
say
you
have
changed
for
the
better
you
ve
learned
to
cover
it
up
she
looked
inquiringly
at
me
but
i
did
not
care
to
explain
what
the
it
was
that
she
had
learned
to
cover
a
slight
flush
appeared
in
her
cheeks
and
i
knew
intuitively
that
she
thought
i
was
alluding
to
her
humble
origin
i
did
not
disabuse
her
mind
of
this
impression
she
would
have
been
angry
had
i
explained
that
i
meant
her
social
ambitions
which
i
thought
vulgar
and
she
thought
refined
both
she
and
margot
except
in
occasional
unguarded
moments
in
privacy
had
indeed
vastly
improved
in
manners
they
had
learned
the
trick
of
the
aristocrats
they
associated
with
the
trick
of
affecting
simplicity
and
equality
and
quietly
confident
ease
there
was
a
notable
difference
and
altogether
in
their
favor
between
their
manners
and
the
manners
of
the
former
mrs
armitage
and
other
american
women
whatever
might
justly
be
said
in
the
way
of
criticism
of
my
wife
it
assuredly
could
not
be
said
that
she
was
lacking
in
agility
at
catching
on
armitage
once
said
to
me
your
wife
is
a
marvelous
woman
i
never
saw
or
heard
of
her
making
a
break
this
tribute
can
be
appreciated
only
when
you
recall
whence
she
sprung
and
how
much
of
her
origin
remained
with
her
necessarily
through
all
her
climbings
and
soarings
you
prefer
it
over
here
said
i
we
were
still
driving
if
it
weren
t
for
you
i
d
never
go
back
said
she
for
me
said
i
oh
don
t
bother
about
me
but
i
do
replied
she
sweetly
and
her
hand
covertly
stole
into
mine
for
a
moment
sometimes
i
get
so
homesick
godfrey
that
s
it
all
i
can
do
to
fight
off
the
impulse
to
take
the
first
steamer
i
tried
to
look
as
a
man
should
on
hearing
such
pleasant
and
praiseworthy
sentiments
from
the
wife
of
his
bosom
you
ve
acted
cold
and
and
reserved
with
me
she
went
on
i
wanted
to
come
to
you
last
night
but
i
hadn
t
the
courage
you
are
such
a
mixture
of
tenderness
and
and
aloofness
you
have
the
power
to
make
even
me
feel
like
a
stranger
i
m
sure
i
don
t
mean
to
be
that
way
said
i
thoroughly
uncomfortable
margot
was
speaking
of
it
proceeded
edna
she
said
poor
affectionate
child
that
she
hardly
dared
put
her
arms
round
you
and
kiss
you
you
oughtn
t
to
repulse
the
child
that
way
godfrey
she
has
a
tender
loving
heart
and
she
adores
you
she
and
i
talk
of
you
a
long
time
every
day
i
d
insist
on
it
as
a
matter
of
duty
for
i
d
not
let
your
child
forget
you
but
i
don
t
need
to
insist
she
refers
everything
to
you
and
whenever
she
s
unusually
happy
she
always
says
if
papa
could
only
be
enjoying
this
with
us
i
saw
that
she
had
worked
herself
up
into
a
state
of
excitement
my
good
sense
told
me
that
there
was
no
genuineness
in
either
her
affection
or
margot
s
but
i
had
no
doubt
they
both
thought
themselves
genuine
and
that
was
quite
enough
to
give
me
the
easy
going
american
slob
of
a
husband
and
father
an
acute
attack
of
guilty
conscience
the
upshot
was
but
you
who
have
an
impressionable
heart
and
a
keen
sense
of
your
own
shortcomings
can
guess
what
it
was
edna
and
i
resumed
the
relations
of
affectionate
husband
and
wife
for
the
rest
of
my
brief
stop
in
london
i
remained
several
days
longer
than
i
had
intended
stayed
on
because
i
did
not
wish
to
hurt
her
feelings
and
i
bought
her
and
margot
all
sorts
of
jewelry
and
gew
gaws
largely
increased
her
personal
fortune
did
not
utter
a
word
that
would
ruffle
either
of
them
and
i
left
them
convinced
that
i
was
going
only
because
business
not
to
be
neglected
compelled
they
say
that
the
hypocrite
wife
is
a
common
occurrence
i
wonder
if
the
hypocrite
husband
is
rare
i
wonder
if
there
are
not
more
instances
than
this
one
of
the
husband
and
the
wife
playing
a
cross
game
of
hypocrisy
with
each
fancying
the
other
deceived
so
busy
was
i
with
my
own
laborings
to
deceive
my
wife
as
to
the
true
state
of
my
feelings
toward
her
that
not
until
i
was
halfway
across
the
atlantic
did
i
happen
to
think
the
obvious
thought
you
gentle
reader
have
not
thought
it
but
perhaps
some
more
intelligent
species
of
reader
has
in
mid
atlantic
i
suddenly
thought
why
she
she
and
margot
were
playing
a
game
the
same
game
for
what
purpose
it
was
not
many
months
before
i
found
out
vii
that
summer
armitage
was
spending
the
week
ends
out
on
long
island
at
the
country
place
of
his
sister
mrs
kirkwood
he
kept
his
yacht
in
the
tiny
harbor
there
and
made
short
cruises
in
the
sound
and
up
the
new
england
coast
naturally
i
often
went
with
him
those
parties
usually
amused
me
he
knew
a
dozen
interesting
people
working
people
such
as
boris
raphael
the
painter
and
his
wife
the
architect
the
horace
armstrongs
who
had
been
divorced
and
remarried
a
novelist
named
beechman
who
wrote
about
the
woods
and
lived
in
the
wilderness
in
the
southwest
most
of
the
year
susan
lenox
the
actress
several
others
of
the
same
kind
then
there
was
his
sister
mary
kirkwood
for
a
reason
which
will
presently
appear
i
have
not
before
spoken
of
mrs
kirkwood
though
i
had
known
her
longer
than
i
had
known
armitage
her
husband
had
been
treasurer
of
the
road
when
i
was
an
under
vice
president
he
speculated
in
the
road
s
funds
and
it
so
happened
that
when
he
was
about
to
be
caught
i
was
the
only
man
who
could
save
him
from
exposure
instead
of
asking
me
directly
he
sent
his
wife
to
me
i
can
see
her
now
as
she
was
that
day
pale
haggard
but
with
that
perfect
composure
which
deceives
the
average
human
being
into
thinking
here
is
a
person
without
nerves
she
told
me
the
whole
story
in
the
manner
of
one
relating
a
matter
in
which
he
has
a
sympathetic
but
remote
interest
she
made
not
the
smallest
attempt
to
work
upon
my
feelings
to
move
me
to
pity
and
she
ended
if
you
will
help
him
cover
up
the
shortage
it
will
be
made
good
and
he
will
resign
i
shall
see
to
it
that
he
does
not
take
another
position
of
trust
why
didn
t
he
come
to
me
himself
said
i
why
did
he
send
you
she
looked
at
me
a
steady
gaze
from
a
pair
of
melancholy
gray
eyes
i
cannot
answer
that
said
she
i
beg
your
pardon
stammered
i
for
i
guessed
the
answer
to
my
question
even
as
i
was
asking
it
i
knew
the
man
an
arrogant
coward
with
the
vanity
to
lure
him
into
doing
preposterous
things
and
wilting
weakness
the
instant
trouble
began
to
gather
you
wish
me
to
save
him
i
said
still
confused
and
not
knowing
how
to
meet
the
situation
i
am
asking
rather
for
myself
replied
she
i
married
him
against
my
father
s
wishes
and
warning
i
have
not
loved
him
since
the
second
month
of
our
marriage
if
he
should
be
exposed
i
think
the
disgrace
would
kill
me
her
lip
curled
in
self
scorn
a
queer
kind
of
pride
isn
t
it
she
said
to
be
able
to
live
through
the
real
shame
and
to
shrink
only
from
the
false
i
ll
do
it
said
i
with
a
sudden
complete
change
of
intention
that
is
if
you
promise
me
he
will
resign
and
not
try
to
get
a
similar
position
elsewhere
i
promise
said
she
rising
to
show
that
she
was
taking
not
a
moment
more
of
my
time
than
was
unavoidable
and
i
thank
you
and
that
was
all
i
kept
my
part
of
the
agreement
she
kept
hers
in
about
two
years
she
divorced
him
because
he
was
flagrantly
untrue
to
her
he
married
the
woman
and
supported
her
and
himself
on
the
allowance
mary
kirkwood
made
him
as
soon
as
her
father
s
death
let
her
into
her
share
of
the
property
when
i
saw
her
again
one
night
at
dinner
at
her
brother
s
house
before
his
wife
divorced
him
we
met
as
if
we
were
entire
strangers
neither
of
us
made
the
remotest
allusion
to
that
first
meeting
going
down
to
her
house
with
armitage
often
and
being
with
her
on
the
yacht
for
days
together
i
became
fairly
well
acquainted
with
her
although
she
maintained
the
reserve
which
she
did
not
increase
for
a
stranger
or
drop
even
with
her
brother
you
felt
as
if
her
personality
were
a
large
and
interesting
house
with
room
after
room
worth
seeing
most
attractive
but
that
no
one
ever
was
admitted
beyond
the
drawing
room
not
for
a
glimpse
don
t
picture
her
as
of
the
somber
sort
of
person
a
real
tragedy
can
befall
only
a
person
with
a
highly
sensitive
nature
such
persons
always
have
sense
of
proportion
and
sense
of
humor
they
do
not
exaggerate
themselves
they
see
the
amusing
side
of
the
antics
of
the
human
animal
so
they
do
not
pull
long
faces
and
swathe
themselves
in
yards
of
cr
pe
and
try
to
create
an
impression
of
dark
and
gloomy
sorrow
they
do
not
find
woe
a
luxury
they
know
it
in
its
grim
horror
they
strive
to
get
the
joy
out
of
life
so
looking
at
mary
kirkwood
you
would
never
have
suspected
a
secret
of
sadness
a
blighted
life
as
her
reserve
did
not
come
from
self
consciousness
either
the
self
consciousness
of
haughtiness
or
that
of
shyness
and
greenness
you
did
not
even
suspect
reserve
until
you
had
known
her
long
and
had
tried
in
vain
to
get
as
well
acquainted
with
her
as
you
thought
you
were
at
first
i
imagine
that
in
our
talk
in
my
office
about
her
husband
i
got
further
into
the
secret
of
her
than
anyone
else
ever
had
one
detail
i
shall
put
by
itself
so
important
does
it
seem
to
me
she
had
a
keen
sense
of
humor
it
was
not
merely
passive
merely
appreciation
as
the
sense
of
humor
is
apt
to
be
in
women
where
it
exists
at
all
it
was
also
active
she
said
droll
and
even
witty
things
when
her
sense
of
humor
was
aroused
her
eyes
were
bewitching
what
did
she
look
like
the
women
all
wish
to
know
this
for
being
fond
of
the
evanescent
triumphs
over
the
male
which
beauty
of
face
or
form
gives
and
as
a
rule
having
experience
only
of
those
petty
victories
they
fancy
that
looks
are
the
important
factor
the
all
important
factor
in
fact
the
real
conquests
of
women
are
not
won
by
looks
beauty
or
rather
physical
charm
of
some
kind
is
the
lure
that
draws
the
desired
male
within
range
if
after
pausing
a
while
he
finds
nothing
more
he
is
off
again
perhaps
probably
my
experience
with
edna
has
made
me
more
indifferent
to
looks
than
the
average
man
who
has
never
realized
his
longing
to
possess
a
physically
beautiful
woman
however
that
may
be
mary
kirkwood
certainly
had
no
cause
to
complain
that
nature
had
not
been
generous
to
her
in
the
matter
of
looks
she
was
tall
she
was
slender
she
had
a
delicate
oval
face
a
skin
that
was
clear
and
smooth
and
dark
with
the
much
prized
olive
tints
in
it
she
had
a
beautiful
long
neck
a
great
quantity
of
almost
black
hair
her
nose
suggested
pride
her
mouth
mockery
her
eyes
sincerity
she
was
the
kind
of
woman
who
exercises
a
powerful
physical
fascination
over
men
and
at
the
same
time
makes
them
afraid
to
show
their
feelings
women
like
that
tantalize
with
visions
of
what
they
could
and
would
give
the
man
they
loved
but
make
each
man
feel
that
it
would
be
idle
for
him
to
hope
in
character
she
was
very
different
from
her
cynical
mocking
brother
was
i
imagine
more
like
her
father
mentally
the
resemblance
between
the
brother
and
sister
was
strong
but
she
took
pains
to
conceal
how
much
she
knew
where
he
found
his
chief
pleasure
in
showing
off
i
feel
i
have
fallen
pitifully
short
of
doing
her
justice
in
this
description
but
who
can
put
into
words
such
a
subtlety
as
charm
she
had
it
for
men
women
did
not
like
her
nor
she
them
i
state
this
without
fear
of
prejudicing
either
women
or
men
against
her
why
is
it
by
the
way
that
to
say
a
man
does
not
like
men
and
is
not
liked
by
them
is
to
damn
him
utterly
while
to
say
that
a
woman
neither
likes
nor
is
liked
by
her
own
sex
is
rather
to
speak
in
her
favor
you
cry
indignantly
not
true
gentle
reader
but
do
you
know
what
is
true
and
what
not
true
and
if
you
did
would
you
confess
it
even
to
yourself
you
are
proceeding
to
revenge
yourself
upon
me
you
are
saying
now
we
know
why
he
was
indifferent
to
his
beautiful
wife
and
to
his
lovely
daughter
now
we
understand
that
fit
of
guilty
conscience
in
london
do
you
know
perhaps
i
am
not
sure
i
am
not
conscious
of
any
especial
interest
in
mary
kirkwood
until
after
i
came
back
from
london
i
had
seen
her
but
a
few
times
we
had
never
talked
so
long
as
five
consecutive
minutes
and
then
we
had
talked
commonplaces
not
the
commonplaces
of
fashionable
people
but
the
commonplaces
of
intelligent
people
there
s
an
enormous
difference
the
first
time
my
memory
records
her
with
the
vividness
of
moving
pictures
is
of
course
at
that
meeting
in
my
office
the
next
time
is
a
few
days
after
my
return
from
london
i
had
been
surfeited
both
in
london
and
on
the
steamer
with
the
inane
amateurs
at
life
the
shallow
elegant
dabblers
in
it
interesting
themselves
only
in
coaching
bridge
and
similar
pastimes
worthy
an
asylum
for
the
feeble
minded
i
went
down
to
the
kirkwood
place
with
armitage
as
his
sister
was
not
in
the
house
we
set
out
for
a
walk
through
the
grounds
to
find
her
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
gardens
a
workman
told
us
that
if
we
would
follow
a
path
through
the
swampy
woods
we
could
not
miss
her
the
path
was
the
roughest
kind
of
a
trail
our
journey
was
beset
with
swarms
of
insects
most
of
them
mosquitoes
in
savage
humor
it
lay
along
the
course
of
a
sluggish
narrow
stream
that
looked
malarious
and
undoubtedly
was
landscape
gardening
is
one
of
mary
s
fads
explained
her
brother
she
has
been
planning
to
tackle
this
swamp
for
several
years
now
she
is
at
it
in
the
depths
of
the
morass
we
came
upon
her
she
was
in
man
s
clothes
laboring
man
s
clothes
her
face
and
neck
were
protected
by
veils
her
hands
by
gloves
she
was
toiling
away
with
a
gang
of
men
at
clearing
the
ground
where
the
drains
were
to
center
in
an
artificial
lake
armitage
called
several
times
before
she
heard
then
she
dropped
her
ax
and
came
forward
to
meet
us
there
was
certainly
nothing
of
what
is
usually
regarded
as
feminine
allure
about
her
yet
never
had
i
seen
a
woman
more
fascinating
there
undoubtedly
was
charm
in
her
face
and
in
her
strong
slender
figure
but
i
believe
the
real
charm
of
charms
for
me
was
the
spectacle
of
a
woman
usefully
employed
a
woman
actually
doing
something
a
woman
after
the
greeting
she
said
the
only
way
i
can
get
the
men
to
work
in
this
pesthole
is
by
working
with
them
she
smiled
merrily
one
doesn
t
look
so
well
as
in
a
fresh
tennis
suit
wielding
a
racket
but
i
can
t
bear
doing
things
that
have
no
results
my
father
insisted
on
bringing
us
up
in
the
commonest
way
and
with
the
commonest
tastes
said
armitage
and
mary
has
remained
even
less
the
lady
than
i
am
the
gentleman
as
the
mosquitoes
were
tearing
us
to
pieces
mrs
kirkwood
ordered
us
back
to
the
house
before
we
were
out
of
sight
she
was
leading
on
her
gang
and
wielding
the
ax
again
at
dinner
she
appeared
in
all
the
radiance
and
grace
of
the
beautiful
woman
with
fondness
for
and
taste
in
dress
she
explained
to
me
her
plan
how
swamp
and
sluggish
rotting
brook
were
to
be
transformed
into
a
wooded
park
with
a
swift
clear
stream
and
a
succession
of
cascades
i
may
add
she
carried
out
the
plan
and
the
results
were
even
beyond
what
my
imagination
pictured
as
she
talked
this
first
view
of
her
life
in
the
country
set
me
to
observing
her
closely
perhaps
more
closely
and
from
a
different
standpoint
than
a
man
usually
observes
a
woman
in
all
she
did
i
saw
the
same
rare
and
fascinating
imagination
the
only
kind
of
imagination
worth
while
of
all
its
stupidities
and
follies
none
so
completely
convicts
the
human
race
of
shallowness
and
bad
taste
as
its
notions
of
what
is
romantic
and
idealistic
the
more
elegant
the
human
animal
flatters
itself
it
is
the
poorer
are
its
ideals
that
is
the
further
removed
from
the
practical
and
the
useful
so
you
rarely
find
a
woman
with
so
much
true
poetry
true
romance
true
imagination
as
to
keep
house
well
but
mary
kirkwood
kept
house
as
a
truly
great
artist
paints
a
picture
as
a
truly
great
composer
creates
an
opera
in
all
her
house
there
was
not
a
trace
of
the
crude
costly
luxury
that
rivals
the
squalor
and
bareness
of
poverty
in
repulsiveness
to
people
of
sense
and
taste
but
what
comfort
what
splendid
cooking
what
perfection
of
service
the
chairs
and
sofas
the
beds
the
linen
the
hundred
and
one
small
but
important
devices
for
facilitating
the
material
side
of
life
and
so
putting
mind
and
spirit
in
the
mood
for
their
best
but
i
despair
of
making
you
realize
i
should
have
to
catalogue
describe
contrast
through
page
after
page
and
when
i
had
finished
those
who
understand
what
the
phrase
art
of
living
means
would
have
read
only
what
they
already
know
while
those
who
do
not
understand
that
phrase
would
be
convulsed
with
the
cackling
laughter
that
is
the
tribute
of
mush
brain
to
intellect
observing
mary
kirkwood
i
discovered
a
great
truth
about
the
woman
question
the
crudest
indictment
of
the
intellect
of
woman
is
the
crude
archaic
futile
and
unimaginative
way
in
which
is
carried
on
the
part
of
life
that
is
woman
s
peculiar
work
or
rather
is
messed
muddled
slopped
and
neglected
no
doubt
this
is
not
their
fault
but
it
soon
will
be
if
they
don
t
bestir
themselves
already
there
are
american
men
not
a
few
who
apologize
for
having
married
as
a
folly
of
their
green
and
silly
youth
so
gentle
reader
though
my
enthusiasm
tempts
me
to
describe
mary
kirkwood
s
housekeeping
in
detail
i
shall
spare
you
you
would
not
read
you
would
not
understand
if
you
did
the
first
time
she
and
i
approached
the
confidential
was
on
an
august
evening
when
we
were
alone
on
the
upper
deck
of
the
yacht
the
others
were
in
the
cabin
playing
bridge
we
had
been
sitting
there
perhaps
an
hour
when
she
rose
don
t
go
said
i
i
thought
you
wished
to
be
alone
said
she
why
did
you
think
that
your
way
of
answering
me
you
ve
been
almost
curt
i
m
sorry
i
can
t
promise
to
talk
if
you
stay
but
i
hate
to
be
left
alone
with
my
thoughts
i
understand
said
she
and
she
seated
herself
beside
the
rail
and
with
my
assistance
lighted
a
cigarette
there
was
a
moon
somewhere
above
the
awning
which
gave
us
a
roof
by
the
dim
uncertain
light
i
could
make
out
her
features
it
seemed
to
me
she
was
staying
as
much
on
her
own
account
as
on
mine
because
she
too
wished
not
to
be
alone
with
her
thoughts
i
had
not
in
a
long
time
seen
her
in
a
frankly
serious
mood
how
much
better
off
a
man
is
than
a
woman
said
i
a
man
has
his
career
to
think
about
while
a
woman
usually
has
only
herself
only
herself
echoed
she
absently
and
if
one
is
able
to
think
oneself
is
an
unsatisfactory
subject
extremely
said
i
faults
follies
failures
for
a
time
i
watched
the
faintly
glowing
end
of
her
cigarette
and
the
slim
fingers
that
held
it
gracefully
then
she
said
do
you
believe
in
a
future
life
does
anyone
feel
sure
of
any
life
but
this
then
this
is
one
s
only
chance
to
get
what
one
wants
what
s
worth
while
what
is
worth
while
i
inquired
feeling
the
charm
of
her
quiet
sweet
voice
issuing
upon
the
magical
stillness
what
is
worth
while
she
laughed
softly
what
one
wants
and
what
do
you
want
she
drew
her
white
scarf
closer
about
her
bare
shoulders
smiled
queerly
out
over
the
lazily
rippling
waters
love
and
children
she
said
i
m
a
normal
woman
that
amused
me
normal
why
you
re
unique
eccentric
most
women
want
money
and
yet
more
money
and
yet
more
money
for
more
and
more
and
always
more
show
you
must
want
the
same
thing
retorted
she
you
re
too
sensible
not
to
know
you
can
t
possibly
do
any
good
to
others
with
money
so
you
must
want
it
for
your
own
selfish
purposes
it
s
every
bit
as
much
for
show
when
you
have
it
tucked
away
in
large
masses
for
people
to
gape
at
as
if
you
were
throwing
it
round
as
the
women
do
if
anything
your
passion
is
cruder
than
theirs
i
think
i
make
money
said
i
for
the
same
reasons
that
a
hen
lays
eggs
or
a
cow
gives
milk
because
i
can
t
help
it
because
i
can
t
do
anything
else
and
must
do
something
did
you
ever
try
to
do
anything
else
no
i
admitted
then
i
added
i
never
had
the
chance
true
she
said
reflectively
a
hen
can
t
give
milk
and
a
cow
can
t
lay
eggs
for
some
time
i
went
on
i
ve
been
trying
to
find
something
else
to
do
something
interesting
no
not
exactly
that
either
i
must
find
some
way
of
reviving
my
interest
in
life
the
things
i
am
doing
would
be
interesting
enough
if
i
could
be
interested
in
anything
at
all
but
i
m
not
she
nodded
slowly
i
m
in
the
same
state
said
she
i
ve
about
decided
what
to
do
yes
said
i
encouragingly
marry
again
replied
she
i
laughed
outright
that
s
very
unoriginal
said
i
it
puts
you
in
with
the
rest
of
the
women
marrying
is
all
they
can
think
of
doing
but
you
don
t
quite
understand
said
she
i
want
children
i
am
thinking
of
selecting
some
trustworthy
man
with
good
physical
and
mental
qualities
i
have
had
experience
i
ought
to
be
able
to
judge
and
not
being
in
love
with
him
i
shall
not
be
so
likely
to
make
a
mistake
i
shall
marry
and
the
children
will
give
me
love
and
occupation
you
may
laugh
but
i
tell
you
the
only
occupation
worthy
of
a
man
or
a
woman
is
bringing
up
children
all
the
rest
for
men
as
well
as
for
women
is
is
like
a
hen
laying
eggs
to
rot
in
the
weeds
bringing
up
children
to
develop
us
to
give
us
a
chance
to
make
them
an
improvement
on
ourselves
that
s
the
best
as
the
full
meaning
of
what
she
had
said
unfolded
i
was
filled
with
astonishment
how
clear
and
simple
how
true
why
had
i
not
seen
this
long
ago
why
had
it
been
necessary
to
have
it
pointed
out
by
another
i
believe
yes
i
m
sure
that
s
what
i
ve
been
groping
for
i
said
to
her
i
thought
you
d
understand
said
she
and
most
flattering
was
her
tone
of
pleasure
at
my
obvious
admiration
thus
our
friendship
was
born
i
could
not
but
envy
her
freedom
to
seek
to
satisfy
the
longing
i
thus
discovered
in
my
own
heart
so
strongly
did
the
mood
for
confidence
possess
me
that
only
my
long
and
hard
training
in
self
restraint
held
me
from
the
disloyalty
of
speaking
my
thoughts
i
said
it
s
dismal
to
grow
old
with
no
ties
in
the
oncoming
generation
the
sense
of
the
utter
futility
of
life
would
weigh
more
and
more
heavily
i
m
surprised
that
you
ve
realized
it
so
young
a
woman
realizes
it
earlier
than
a
man
she
reminded
me
for
a
woman
has
no
career
to
interfere
and
prevent
her
seeing
the
truth
a
woman
rather
a
rare
occasional
mary
kirkwood
most
women
never
looked
beyond
the
gratification
of
the
crudest
easiest
vanities
and
appetites
yes
you
are
right
i
continued
you
ought
to
marry
as
soon
as
you
can
the
man
isn
t
important
except
in
the
ways
you
spoke
of
so
far
as
man
and
woman
love
is
concerned
that
quickly
passes
where
it
ever
exists
at
all
but
the
bond
of
father
mother
and
children
is
enduring
at
least
i
m
sure
you
would
make
it
so
we
sat
lost
in
thought
for
some
time
i
reflecting
moodily
upon
my
own
baffled
and
now
seemingly
hopeless
longing
she
probably
busy
with
the
ideas
suggested
in
her
next
speech
the
main
trouble
is
money
said
she
except
for
that
my
husband
would
have
been
all
right
when
we
first
met
he
did
not
know
my
family
had
wealth
he
thought
i
belonged
to
another
and
poor
branch
and
i
think
he
cared
for
me
and
would
have
been
the
man
i
sought
but
for
the
money
it
roused
a
dormant
side
of
his
nature
and
everything
went
to
pieces
then
marry
a
rich
man
i
suggested
she
shook
her
head
i
don
t
know
a
single
rich
man
except
possibly
my
brother
who
isn
t
obsessed
about
money
the
rich
have
a
craving
to
be
richer
that
s
worse
than
the
desire
of
the
poor
to
be
rich
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
i
couldn
t
bring
up
children
in
the
atmosphere
of
wealth
and
caste
and
show
the
sort
of
atmosphere
a
man
or
woman
crazy
about
money
insists
on
creating
my
father
was
right
he
was
a
really
wise
man
i
owe
to
him
every
good
instinct
and
good
idea
i
have
but
you
must
have
seen
some
man
who
promised
well
i
think
you
can
trust
to
your
judgment
you
mustn
t
defeat
your
one
chance
for
happiness
by
overcaution
again
she
was
silent
for
several
minutes
then
she
said
with
a
queer
laugh
and
an
embarrassed
movement
i
have
seen
such
a
man
lately
i
like
him
i
think
i
could
like
him
more
than
a
little
i
ve
an
idea
he
might
care
for
me
if
i
d
let
him
but
i
don
t
know
i
saw
that
she
longed
to
confide
but
wished
to
be
questioned
here
on
the
yacht
said
i
she
nodded
beechman
she
laughed
shyly
yet
with
amusement
that
was
an
easy
guess
said
i
he
s
the
only
man
of
us
free
to
marry
what
do
you
think
of
him
the
very
man
i
d
say
replied
i
he
s
good
to
look
at
clever
healthy
and
honest
he
isn
t
money
mad
he
could
make
quite
a
splurge
with
what
he
has
yet
he
doesn
t
he
is
a
serious
man
does
not
let
them
tempt
him
into
fashionable
society
or
any
other
kind
what
are
the
objections
said
she
my
father
trained
us
to
look
for
the
rotten
spots
as
he
called
them
he
said
one
ought
to
hunt
them
out
and
examine
them
carefully
then
if
in
spite
of
them
the
thing
still
looked
good
why
there
was
a
chance
of
its
being
worth
taking
that
s
precisely
my
way
of
proceeding
in
business
said
i
it
s
a
pity
it
isn
t
used
in
every
part
of
life
from
marketing
up
to
choosing
a
friend
or
a
husband
well
what
are
the
rotten
spots
in
mr
beechman
i
haven
t
looked
for
them
said
i
no
doubt
they
re
there
but
as
they
re
not
obvious
they
may
be
unimportant
can
t
you
think
of
any
she
was
laughing
and
so
was
i
poor
beechman
down
in
the
cabin
absorbed
in
bridge
how
amazed
he
d
have
been
if
he
could
have
heard
in
my
mind
s
eye
i
was
looking
him
over
a
tall
fair
man
with
good
smooth
shaven
features
he
s
getting
bald
rather
rapidly
for
a
man
of
thirty
or
thereabouts
said
i
i
don
t
like
baldness
said
she
but
i
can
endure
it
he
is
distinctly
vain
of
his
looks
and
his
strength
but
he
has
cause
to
be
all
men
are
physically
vain
said
she
and
they
can
t
help
it
because
it
is
the
hereditary
quality
of
the
male
from
fishes
and
reptiles
up
he
s
inclined
to
be
opinionated
and
his
point
of
view
is
narrow
i
think
i
might
hope
to
educate
him
out
of
that
said
she
i
can
be
tactful
it
s
certainly
not
a
serious
objection
any
other
spots
he
has
a
certain
a
certain
lack
of
vigor
it
s
a
thing
i
ve
observed
in
all
professional
men
except
those
of
the
first
rank
those
who
are
really
men
of
action
she
nodded
i
was
waiting
for
that
said
she
it
s
the
thing
that
has
made
me
hesitate
she
laughed
outright
what
a
conceited
speech
but
i
m
exposing
myself
fully
to
you
why
not
said
i
i
am
picking
him
to
pieces
as
if
i
thought
myself
perfection
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
know
he
d
fly
from
me
if
he
saw
me
as
i
am
she
reflected
laughed
quietly
but
he
never
would
know
me
as
i
am
an
unconventional
woman
if
she
s
sensible
only
shows
enough
of
her
variation
from
the
pattern
to
make
herself
interesting
never
enough
to
be
alarming
you
are
unconventional
you
didn
t
suspect
it
no
you
smoke
cigarettes
but
that
has
ceased
to
be
unconventional
i
rather
thought
you
had
a
favorable
opinion
of
my
intelligence
said
she
so
i
have
said
i
to
be
perfectly
frank
you
seemed
to
me
to
have
as
good
a
mind
as
your
brother
that
is
flattering
said
she
immensely
pleased
and
with
reason
well
if
you
thought
so
favorably
of
my
intelligence
how
could
you
believe
me
conventional
i
see
said
i
no
one
who
thinks
can
be
conventional
conventionality
said
she
was
invented
to
save
some
people
the
trouble
of
thinking
and
to
prevent
others
from
being
outrageous
through
trying
to
think
when
they
ve
nothing
to
think
with
that
is
worth
remembering
and
repeating
laughed
i
personally
i
m
deeply
grateful
for
conventionality
you
see
i
came
up
from
the
bottom
and
i
find
it
satisfactory
to
be
able
to
refer
to
the
rules
in
all
the
things
i
knew
nothing
about
my
brother
says
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
you
and
your
wife
do
you
mind
my
telling
you
go
on
said
i
he
says
most
people
who
come
up
are
alternately
hopeless
barbarians
and
hopelessly
conventional
but
that
you
took
the
right
course
you
learned
to
be
conventional
learned
the
rules
before
you
ventured
to
try
to
make
personal
variations
in
them
i
m
slow
to
risk
variations
said
i
most
of
the
efforts
in
that
direction
are
eccentric
and
i
detest
eccentricity
as
much
as
i
like
originality
if
mr
beechman
were
only
a
little
less
conventional
sighed
she
i
m
afraid
he
d
be
rather
she
hesitated
tiresome
i
ventured
to
suggest
tiresome
she
assented
but
there
would
be
the
children
do
you
think
he
d
try
to
interfere
with
me
there
you
ll
never
know
that
until
you
ve
married
him
said
i
it
s
a
pity
he
has
an
occupation
that
would
keep
him
round
the
house
most
of
the
time
said
she
that
s
a
trial
to
a
woman
she
s
always
being
interrupted
when
she
wishes
to
be
free
you
mustn
t
expect
too
much
said
i
i
think
the
children
will
be
your
children
she
did
not
reply
in
words
but
a
sudden
strengthening
of
her
expression
made
me
feel
that
i
was
getting
a
glimpse
of
her
father
we
talked
no
more
of
beechman
or
of
any
personalities
related
to
this
story
when
the
bridge
party
broke
up
and
a
supper
was
served
on
deck
she
and
beechman
sat
together
and
i
gathered
from
the
sounds
coming
from
their
direction
that
he
was
making
progress
my
spirits
gradually
oozed
away
and
i
sat
glumly
pretending
to
listen
while
mrs
raphael
talked
to
me
usually
she
interested
me
because
she
talked
what
she
knew
and
knew
things
worth
while
but
that
night
i
heard
scarcely
a
word
she
said
when
the
party
one
by
one
began
to
go
below
mrs
kirkwood
joined
me
and
found
an
opportunity
to
say
aside
won
t
you
talk
with
mr
beechman
and
tell
me
your
honest
opinion
you
know
i
can
t
afford
to
make
another
mistake
and
i
m
in
earnest
i
stood
silent
smoking
and
staring
out
toward
the
dim
connecticut
shore
it
wouldn
t
be
unfair
to
him
she
urged
you
re
not
especially
his
friend
i
can
t
ask
anyone
else
and
i
believe
in
your
judgment
if
i
advised
you
i
d
be
taking
a
heavy
responsibility
said
i
i
m
not
that
kind
you
know
i
m
not
replied
she
i
don
t
ask
advice
to
have
some
one
to
blame
if
things
go
wrong
of
course
if
there
s
a
reason
why
you
can
t
very
well
help
me
maybe
you
already
know
something
against
him
something
you
ve
no
right
to
tell
nothing
said
i
emphatically
and
i
don
t
believe
there
is
anything
against
him
then
on
an
impulse
of
fairness
and
to
wipe
out
the
suspicion
of
beechman
i
had
unwittingly
created
i
said
really
there
s
no
reason
why
i
shouldn
t
size
him
up
and
give
you
my
opinion
i
ll
do
my
best
she
thanked
me
with
a
fine
lighting
up
of
the
eyes
and
the
warm
friendly
pressure
of
her
hand
lingered
after
she
had
long
been
below
and
was
no
doubt
asleep
what
was
my
reason
for
hesitating
you
have
guessed
it
but
you
think
i
do
not
intend
to
admit
you
are
deceived
there
i
admit
frankly
i
felt
unable
to
advise
her
because
i
found
that
i
was
in
love
with
her
myself
yes
i
was
in
love
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
the
latest
time
of
falling
in
love
is
always
the
first
as
we
become
older
and
more
experienced
better
acquainted
with
the
world
with
ourselves
with
what
we
want
and
do
not
want
in
a
word
as
we
grow
the
meaning
of
love
grows
and
each
time
we
love
we
see
as
we
look
back
over
the
previous
times
that
what
we
thought
was
love
was
in
fact
simply
educational
so
when
i
say
i
had
never
loved
until
i
loved
mary
kirkwood
i
am
speaking
a
truth
which
is
worth
thinking
about
i
had
reached
the
age
the
stage
of
physical
and
mental
development
at
which
a
man
s
capacities
are
at
their
largest
at
which
i
could
give
love
and
could
appreciate
love
that
was
given
to
me
and
i
who
could
not
ask
or
hope
love
from
her
gave
her
all
the
love
i
had
to
give
gave
because
i
could
not
help
giving
who
seeing
the
best
can
help
wanting
it
but
for
my
promise
to
her
i
should
have
left
the
yacht
early
the
following
morning
as
it
was
i
stayed
on
with
my
mind
made
up
to
keep
my
word
did
i
stay
because
of
my
promise
did
i
stay
because
i
loved
her
i
do
not
know
who
can
fathom
the
real
motive
in
such
a
situation
as
that
i
can
only
say
that
i
sought
beechman
s
society
and
did
my
best
to
take
his
measure
it
had
been
so
long
my
habit
to
judge
men
without
regard
to
my
personal
feeling
about
them
that
perhaps
in
spite
of
myself
i
saw
this
man
as
he
was
not
as
i
should
have
liked
him
to
be
i
found
that
i
had
underestimated
him
i
had
been
prejudiced
by
his
taking
himself
too
seriously
a
form
of
vanity
which
i
happen
particularly
to
detest
also
his
sense
of
humor
was
different
from
mine
a
fact
that
had
misled
me
into
thinking
he
had
no
sense
of
humor
i
had
thought
shall
i
say
hoped
that
i
would
find
him
a
man
she
could
respect
but
could
not
love
i
was
forced
to
abandon
this
idea
so
far
as
a
man
can
judge
another
for
a
woman
he
could
succeed
with
almost
any
heart
free
woman
i
wondered
that
mary
kirkwood
should
be
uncertain
about
him
i
might
have
drawn
comfort
from
her
having
done
so
had
i
not
known
how
she
dreaded
making
a
second
mistake
that
day
and
the
next
when
i
was
not
with
him
she
was
i
shan
t
attempt
to
tell
my
emotions
that
sort
of
thing
seems
absurd
to
all
the
world
but
the
one
who
is
suffering
besides
the
fact
that
i
was
a
married
man
would
alienate
the
sympathies
of
all
respectable
readers
not
that
i
am
yearning
for
sympathy
those
who
have
read
thus
far
may
have
possibly
gathered
that
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
live
on
sympathy
and
wither
and
die
without
it
the
only
sympathy
human
beings
seem
able
to
give
one
another
i
have
discovered
is
a
species
of
self
complacent
pity
and
while
it
may
not
be
exactly
a
stone
it
is
certainly
a
most
inferior
quality
of
bread
the
third
morning
i
sought
her
out
she
made
a
picture
of
strong
slim
young
womanhood
to
cause
the
heart
at
least
my
heart
to
ache
as
she
leaned
against
the
rail
in
her
blue
trimmed
white
linen
dress
showing
her
lovely
throat
said
i
avoiding
her
eyes
i
m
off
for
the
shore
and
i
wish
to
report
before
leaving
ashore
she
cried
why
you
were
to
have
gone
on
to
bar
harbor
and
back
again
business
always
business
i
m
disappointed
said
she
and
i
saw
with
a
furtive
glance
that
her
face
had
quite
lost
its
brightness
i
m
glad
of
that
at
least
said
i
with
a
successful
enough
attempt
at
lightness
for
as
i
have
never
been
the
sort
of
man
in
whom
women
expect
to
find
sentimentalism
signs
of
embarrassment
or
other
agitation
would
be
attributed
to
any
other
source
before
the
heart
i
ve
lost
interest
in
the
trip
she
declared
i
forced
a
smile
beechman
isn
t
going
oh
that
s
different
said
she
with
a
certain
frank
impatience
you
re
the
one
person
i
can
really
talk
to
can
t
you
stay
i
did
not
let
my
face
betray
me
i
waited
before
speaking
until
i
was
sure
of
my
voice
impossible
i
said
perhaps
rather
curtly
for
mind
you
i
wished
to
deal
honestly
with
her
and
was
not
trying
to
hint
my
love
while
pretending
to
hide
it
i
know
there
is
a
notion
that
love
cannot
be
controlled
but
the
kind
of
love
that
can
t
be
controlled
is
a
selfish
greedy
appetite
and
not
love
at
all
when
the
man
doesn
t
control
his
love
the
woman
may
be
sure
he
is
thinking
of
himself
only
of
her
merely
as
a
possible
means
of
pleasure
is
thinking
of
her
as
the
hungry
hunter
thinks
of
the
fine
fat
rabbit
said
i
now
for
my
report
on
beechman
but
she
would
not
let
me
escape
why
are
you
short
with
me
she
asked
have
i
offended
you
no
indeed
said
i
you
ve
been
everything
that
s
kind
and
friendly
the
very
idea
of
losing
your
friendship
frightens
me
she
went
on
i
ve
a
feeling
for
you
a
feeling
of
of
intimacy
she
flushed
rosily
that
i
have
for
no
one
else
in
the
world
oh
i
don
t
expect
you
to
return
it
no
doubt
i
seem
insignificant
to
you
almost
anyone
would
want
your
friendship
you
are
sure
you
aren
t
leaving
because
you
are
bored
absolutely
sure
if
i
could
explain
my
reason
for
going
you
would
see
that
i
must
but
i
can
t
explain
so
you
ll
be
glad
to
hear
that
i
find
beechman
even
more
of
a
man
than
i
thought
she
looked
at
me
apologetically
you
ll
think
me
foolish
but
since
i
ve
begun
to
try
to
like
him
better
i
ve
been
almost
not
liking
him
i
am
sure
i
beamed
with
delight
for
there
are
limits
very
narrow
ones
to
unselfishness
in
the
most
considerate
love
and
i
am
not
able
to
pose
as
more
than
feebly
unselfish
that
isn
t
fair
to
him
i
said
with
more
enthusiasm
in
my
words
than
in
my
tone
i
ve
been
judging
him
as
carefully
as
i
know
how
and
i
must
in
honesty
say
he
is
a
rare
man
you
ll
not
find
many
like
him
don
t
tell
me
he
s
worthy
she
cried
or
i
shall
loathe
him
and
he
cares
for
you
i
said
did
he
tell
you
so
i
think
he
would
have
if
i
had
encouraged
him
i
liked
the
way
he
spoke
of
you
and
i
hesitated
could
not
hold
back
the
words
and
i
am
not
easy
to
please
there
those
words
were
certainly
far
from
confession
were
the
mildest
form
of
indiscretion
still
so
determined
was
i
to
be
square
and
so
guilty
did
i
feel
that
they
sounded
like
a
contemptible
attempt
stealthily
to
make
love
to
her
thank
you
she
said
gently
and
her
suddenly
swimming
eyes
and
tender
voice
reminded
me
how
alone
she
was
and
how
bitter
her
experience
had
been
and
how
she
deserved
happiness
i
felt
ashamed
of
myself
i
hope
you
will
be
happy
i
said
perhaps
rather
huskily
anyone
who
tried
to
prevent
it
would
deserve
to
be
killed
she
looked
at
me
with
such
a
steady
penetrating
gaze
that
i
feared
i
had
betrayed
myself
in
fact
i
knew
i
had
i
glanced
at
my
watch
put
out
my
hand
i
hate
to
go
i
said
in
the
tone
of
one
man
to
another
but
i
must
and
as
we
shook
hands
i
repeated
i
know
you
will
be
happy
she
laughed
nervously
she
too
had
become
ill
at
ease
you
make
me
feel
engaged
she
said
with
an
attempt
at
mockery
as
the
launch
touched
the
shore
i
looked
back
she
was
leaning
on
the
rail
beechman
beside
her
he
was
talking
but
i
felt
sure
she
was
not
listening
as
i
looked
she
waved
her
hand
i
lifted
my
hat
and
hurried
away
and
i
learned
the
meaning
of
that
word
desolation
do
not
think
because
i
have
not
raved
talked
of
the
moon
and
stars
poetized
about
my
soul
states
that
therefore
i
did
not
love
her
the
banquet
of
life
spread
so
richly
for
me
seemed
a
ghastly
mockery
what
shall
it
profit
a
man
if
he
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
his
own
soul
i
had
lost
my
soul
i
had
discovered
how
i
might
have
been
happy
and
at
the
same
time
i
had
discovered
that
it
could
never
be
never
and
always
before
me
she
stood
in
her
radiant
youth
intelligent
so
capable
splendidly
sincere
the
woman
i
loved
the
woman
i
felt
i
could
have
made
love
me
there
was
my
temptation
the
feeling
the
conviction
that
i
could
win
her
love
she
had
confessed
to
a
friendship
for
me
different
from
any
she
had
for
anyone
else
in
the
world
if
i
were
willing
to
take
advantage
of
her
trust
of
her
liking
of
her
longing
for
love
and
of
my
knowledge
of
it
if
i
were
to
let
her
see
how
utterly
i
loved
her
i
could
surely
win
her
there
were
times
when
i
said
to
myself
you
even
as
you
are
can
make
her
happier
than
anyone
else
could
she
would
prefer
what
you
can
give
her
to
what
she
will
get
from
beechman
your
love
gives
you
the
right
to
make
her
happy
you
are
letting
foolish
conventional
notions
blind
you
to
what
is
really
right
if
you
had
acted
in
business
in
that
fashion
you
would
not
have
got
far
yet
in
the
supreme
crisis
of
your
life
you
let
yourself
be
frightened
off
by
a
bogy
of
conventional
morality
perhaps
i
was
giving
myself
sound
advice
there
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
that
i
put
the
temptation
behind
me
and
went
to
work
the
sentimental
readers
will
not
forgive
me
so
be
it
i
am
a
plain
man
rather
old
fashioned
prim
i
believe
it
is
called
in
my
ideas
not
at
all
the
ladies
man
and
i
did
not
want
to
harm
her
i
loved
her
i
went
to
work
the
sort
of
people
who
are
ever
on
the
lookout
for
some
excuse
for
going
to
pieces
and
the
world
is
well
sprinkled
with
them
eagerly
seize
on
disappointment
in
love
as
precisely
what
they
were
seeking
at
the
risk
of
being
thought
cold
and
hard
i
will
say
that
it
is
extremely
fortunate
for
joan
that
she
escaped
the
darby
who
goes
smash
for
disappointed
love
of
her
if
joan
had
yielded
to
him
darby
would
simply
have
been
put
to
the
trouble
of
finding
another
pretext
for
throwing
up
his
job
and
taking
to
drink
i
confess
it
did
not
occur
to
me
to
give
up
and
fall
to
boozing
and
brooding
i
should
not
have
dared
do
that
for
you
see
i
was
really
in
love
not
with
myself
but
with
mary
kirkwood
i
went
to
work
i
filled
my
days
and
my
evenings
with
business
engagements
that
compelled
both
my
time
and
my
thought
i
took
on
an
extra
secretary
i
started
to
build
a
railway
i
laid
out
an
addition
to
the
manufacturing
city
i
had
founded
i
organized
a
farm
for
teaching
city
slum
boys
to
be
farmers
i
engaged
in
several
entirely
new
mining
and
manufacturing
enterprises
the
result
was
that
when
i
went
to
bed
i
slept
and
when
they
awakened
me
in
the
morning
my
brain
was
at
work
before
my
head
was
well
off
the
pillow
and
still
you
can
distract
your
mind
from
the
aching
tooth
but
it
aches
on
all
this
time
i
was
receiving
weekly
letters
from
edna
and
margot
long
and
loving
letters
i
read
them
and
you
may
possibly
imagine
i
was
filled
with
shame
and
remorse
not
at
all
my
wife
and
my
daughter
had
rather
exaggerated
my
vanity
only
vanity
could
gull
a
husband
and
father
in
my
position
into
fancying
himself
the
object
of
such
luxuriant
affection
as
those
letters
professed
if
you
have
lies
to
tell
take
my
advice
and
don
t
write
them
i
can
t
explain
the
mystery
but
a
lie
which
spoken
and
heard
passes
out
and
passes
in
as
smoothly
as
a
greased
shuttle
in
its
greased
groove
becomes
a
glaring
falsehood
when
set
down
in
black
and
white
the
only
effect
of
those
letters
upon
me
was
to
make
my
sick
heart
the
sadder
with
the
realization
of
what
i
had
missed
in
losing
mary
kirkwood
and
i
kept
wondering
what
it
was
that
edna
and
margot
were
slathering
me
for
in
september
i
got
the
key
to
the
mystery
the
necessity
of
floating
some
bonds
took
me
abroad
again
i
found
my
family
ensconced
in
beautiful
luxury
in
an
apartment
in
paris
you
drove
out
the
champs
elys
es
not
far
from
the
president
s
palace
you
drove
in
at
great
doors
not
gates
but
doors
in
a
plain
unpretentious
looking
house
wall
you
were
in
a
superb
garden
of
whose
existence
you
had
no
hint
from
the
street
magnificent
bronze
inner
doors
powdered
and
velveted
lackeys
a
majestic
stairway
leading
to
lofty
and
gorgeous
corridors
and
salons
really
my
wife
with
the
aid
of
those
clever
european
professors
of
the
aristocratic
art
had
educated
herself
amazingly
on
every
side
there
were
evidences
of
her
good
taste
in
furniture
in
tapestries
in
wall
coverings
in
pictures
it
was
not
the
taste
of
a
home
maker
but
it
was
unquestionably
good
taste
it
was
not
the
sort
of
taste
i
liked
but
not
to
admire
it
would
have
been
to
lack
the
sense
of
harmony
in
line
and
color
and
let
me
add
in
justice
to
her
it
was
her
own
taste
there
is
no
mistaking
the
difference
between
the
luxury
that
is
merely
bought
and
the
luxury
that
is
created
i
submitted
with
what
grace
i
could
muster
to
the
exuberant
hypocrisies
of
that
greeting
but
i
got
to
business
with
all
speed
in
the
note
i
found
in
london
you
said
you
had
a
surprise
for
me
i
said
to
edna
what
is
it
how
impatient
you
are
laughed
she
just
like
a
child
whether
because
the
fashions
of
the
day
happened
to
be
peculiarly
becoming
or
because
she
had
actually
improved
she
now
had
the
loveliness
more
exquisite
than
i
had
ever
seen
in
woman
no
doubt
her
piquant
face
had
charm
for
most
people
for
me
it
had
none
whatever
i
knew
too
well
what
lay
beneath
or
rather
what
was
not
there
for
like
most
human
beings
her
defects
of
character
were
not
so
much
the
presence
of
the
vices
as
the
lack
of
the
virtues
i
ve
been
waiting
for
that
surprise
several
months
said
i
your
letters
and
margot
s
showed
that
some
shock
was
coming
shock
no
indeed
and
she
and
margot
laughed
gayly
it
isn
t
altogether
a
surprise
she
went
on
can
t
you
guess
i
looked
at
margot
ah
i
said
margot
is
engaged
margot
ran
across
the
room
and
kissed
me
oh
i
m
so
happy
papa
she
cried
is
it
the
duke
i
asked
she
made
a
wry
face
he
was
horrid
she
said
i
couldn
t
endure
him
so
you
had
to
fall
back
on
the
marquis
neither
of
the
women
liked
this
way
of
putting
the
matter
it
suggested
that
i
knew
the
painful
truth
of
the
failure
of
the
ducal
campaign
but
they
were
not
to
be
put
out
of
humor
you
liked
him
yourself
papa
said
margot
i
was
abstractedly
thinking
how
i
had
no
sense
of
her
being
my
daughter
or
of
edna
being
my
wife
you
would
say
that
after
all
we
three
had
been
through
together
from
passaic
up
it
would
be
a
sheer
impossibility
for
there
ever
to
be
a
sense
of
strangeness
between
us
but
there
is
no
limit
to
the
power
of
the
human
soul
to
cut
itself
off
intimacy
is
hard
to
maintain
isolation
alas
is
the
natural
state
i
looked
on
them
as
strangers
i
could
feel
that
in
spite
of
their
clever
resolute
forcing
in
spite
of
the
hypocrisy
of
love
for
me
which
each
doubtless
maintained
at
all
times
with
the
other
still
they
could
scarcely
hide
their
feeling
that
i
was
a
strange
man
come
in
from
the
street
yes
i
liked
crossley
said
i
i
think
he
ll
make
you
a
good
husband
he
is
mad
about
her
said
edna
there
was
a
while
this
summer
when
he
thought
he
had
lost
her
and
he
all
but
went
out
of
his
mind
to
look
at
her
was
to
believe
it
for
a
lovelier
girl
was
never
displayed
in
all
her
physical
perfection
by
a
more
discriminating
mother
when
is
the
wedding
to
be
said
i
there
was
a
brief
surcharged
silence
no
more
than
a
pause
then
edna
said
indifferently
as
soon
as
the
settlements
are
arranged
oh
is
he
settling
something
on
her
said
i
with
pretended
innocence
i
m
glad
of
that
there
s
been
too
much
of
the
other
sort
of
thing
margot
came
to
the
rescue
with
a
charming
laugh
poor
hugh
she
said
he
hasn
t
anything
but
mortgages
um
i
see
said
i
glumly
and
i
observed
intense
anxiety
behind
the
smiles
in
those
two
pairs
of
beautiful
eyes
how
much
have
we
got
to
pay
for
him
edna
looked
reproachfully
at
me
margot
said
she
you
d
better
go
tell
them
to
serve
lunch
in
fifteen
minutes
nonsense
said
i
cheerfully
let
her
stay
what
s
the
use
of
this
hypocrisy
she
knows
he
cares
no
more
about
her
than
she
cares
about
him
that
it
s
simply
a
matter
of
buying
and
selling
if
she
doesn
t
know
it
if
she
s
letting
her
vanity
bamboozle
her
godfrey
please
implored
edna
don
t
smirch
the
child
s
romance
she
and
hugh
love
each
other
if
she
were
poor
he
d
marry
her
just
the
same
has
he
offered
to
go
ahead
regardless
of
settlements
i
asked
of
course
not
papa
flashed
margot
things
aren
t
done
that
way
over
here
oh
yes
they
are
replied
i
romantic
love
matches
occur
every
day
even
royalty
throws
up
its
rights
to
marry
a
chorus
girl
but
when
there
s
a
fat
american
goose
to
pluck
and
eat
why
they
pluck
and
eat
it
i
m
the
goose
my
dear
not
you
you
don
t
understand
murmured
margot
i
wish
i
didn
t
said
i
and
i
wish
you
didn
t
have
to
understand
if
possible
i
want
to
arrange
matters
with
him
so
that
he
ll
always
treat
you
decently
but
godfrey
cried
edna
in
a
panic
you
can
t
talk
money
to
him
why
not
said
i
he
s
thinking
money
why
shouldn
t
he
talk
it
he
knows
nothing
about
those
things
papa
i
laughed
you
ll
ruin
everything
cried
my
wife
you
ll
make
us
the
laughingstock
of
europe
we
americans
of
the
rich
class
are
that
already
replied
i
edna
must
have
given
her
daughter
some
secret
signal
for
she
abruptly
and
hastily
left
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
her
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
settled
back
on
the
exquisitely
upholstered
and
carved
sofa
on
which
i
had
seated
myself
looking
round
i
said
this
is
a
beautiful
room
you
ve
certainly
arranged
a
fitting
background
for
yourself
and
margot
but
she
was
not
listening
she
was
watching
her
fingers
slowly
twist
and
untwist
the
delicate
little
lace
handkerchief
at
last
she
said
godfrey
i
ve
never
asked
a
favor
of
you
i
ve
given
my
whole
life
to
advancing
your
interests
to
making
our
child
a
perfect
lady
and
to
placing
her
in
a
dazzling
position
yes
said
i
you
have
worked
hard
and
you
ve
made
your
tricks
i
ve
played
my
hand
well
as
you
have
yours
said
she
accepting
my
rather
unrefined
figure
with
good
grace
i
began
to
make
margot
s
career
before
she
was
born
the
first
time
i
saw
her
little
face
i
murmured
to
myself
little
duchess
now
you
understand
why
i
brought
her
up
so
carefully
oh
said
i
looking
at
her
with
new
interest
that
was
it
i
who
knew
what
a
futile
purposeless
easily
discouraged
breed
the
human
race
is
could
not
but
admire
this
woman
if
her
intelligence
had
only
been
equal
to
her
will
what
might
she
not
have
accomplished
i
have
never
lost
sight
of
it
for
a
moment
said
she
in
the
early
days
for
a
time
when
we
were
seemingly
so
hopelessly
obscure
and
i
was
too
ignorant
to
learn
which
way
to
turn
for
a
while
i
was
discouraged
but
i
never
gave
up
never
and
step
by
step
i
ve
trained
her
for
the
grand
position
as
a
leader
of
european
society
she
was
one
day
to
occupy
for
i
knew
that
if
she
led
europe
she
would
be
leader
at
home
too
over
there
they
re
merely
a
feeble
crude
echo
of
europe
socially
said
i
that
s
all
we
re
talking
about
replied
she
that
s
all
there
is
worth
talking
about
what
else
have
you
been
piling
up
money
for
what
else
i
could
think
of
no
reply
i
was
silent
what
else
indeed
i
kept
her
away
from
other
children
edna
went
on
after
she
could
talk
i
never
trusted
her
to
nurses
until
we
could
afford
fashionable
servants
i
got
her
the
right
sort
of
governesses
so
that
she
should
speak
french
italian
and
german
and
should
have
a
well
bred
english
accent
for
her
own
language
i
even
trained
her
in
the
children
s
stories
she
read
had
her
read
only
the
fairy
tales
and
the
other
stories
that
would
fill
her
mind
with
ideas
of
nobility
and
titles
and
the
high
things
of
life
the
high
things
of
life
said
i
she
made
an
impressive
gesture
she
looked
like
a
beautiful
young
empress
let
s
not
cant
said
she
those
are
the
high
things
of
life
ask
any
person
you
meet
in
america
young
or
old
high
or
low
ask
him
which
he
d
rather
be
a
prince
duke
marquis
or
a
saint
scientist
statesman
what
would
he
answer
i
laughed
that
he
d
rather
be
a
millionaire
said
i
a
millionaire
with
a
title
with
established
social
position
at
the
very
top
that
couldn
t
be
taken
away
that
s
the
truth
godfrey
i
ll
not
contradict
you
said
i
and
she
went
on
i
ve
brought
up
our
daughter
so
that
she
could
realize
the
highest
ambition
within
our
reach
haven
t
i
brought
her
up
well
perfectly
for
the
purpose
said
i
when
we
came
over
here
i
examined
the
ground
carefully
i
was
at
first
inclined
to
one
of
the
big
continental
titles
they
are
much
older
much
more
high
sounding
than
the
english
titles
and
so
far
as
birth
goes
they
mean
something
while
the
english
titles
mean
really
nothing
at
all
the
english
aristocracy
isn
t
an
aristocracy
of
birth
that
s
no
doubt
the
reason
why
it
still
has
some
say
in
affairs
said
i
its
talk
about
birth
is
almost
entirely
sham
proceeded
she
not
interested
in
my
irrelevant
comment
but
i
found
that
it
was
the
most
substantial
aristocracy
the
only
one
that
was
respected
everywhere
just
as
the
english
money
circulates
everywhere
and
it
s
the
only
one
that
makes
much
of
an
impression
at
home
we
are
so
ignorant
that
we
think
england
is
all
that
it
pretends
to
be
the
powerful
part
of
europe
of
course
it
isn
t
but
no
matter
i
decided
for
an
english
title
and
margot
i
have
brought
her
up
to
respect
my
judgment
said
edna
i
wonder
what
will
become
of
her
said
i
reflectively
when
she
hasn
t
you
at
her
elbow
to
tell
her
what
to
do
but
why
a
marquis
why
not
a
duke
she
smiled
blushed
a
little
the
only
duke
we
could
have
got
and
he
was
a
nice
young
fellow
but
he
was
in
love
with
an
english
girl
of
wealth
and
he
wanted
too
much
to
change
to
an
american
is
that
frank
enough
to
suit
you
if
you
d
only
keep
to
that
key
said
i
he
wanted
double
the
american
dowry
that
he
was
willing
to
take
with
an
english
girl
his
being
in
love
with
another
girl
might
have
made
it
unpleasant
for
margot
i
suggested
that
wouldn
t
have
amounted
to
anything
replied
she
over
here
the
right
sort
of
people
bring
up
their
children
as
i
brought
up
margot
to
give
their
hearts
where
their
hands
should
go
they
are
not
shallow
and
selfish
they
think
of
the
family
dignity
and
honor
before
they
think
of
their
personal
feelings
that
s
interesting
and
new
at
least
to
me
said
i
you
have
been
judging
these
things
without
knowing
godfrey
said
she
you
have
attacked
me
for
narrowness
when
in
fact
you
were
the
narrow
one
yes
what
next
said
i
i
found
that
the
massingfords
that
s
the
family
name
of
the
marquis
of
crossley
i
found
they
ranked
higher
as
a
family
than
any
of
the
ducal
families
except
one
of
course
i
don
t
include
the
royal
dukes
of
course
not
said
i
gravely
i
might
possibly
have
got
one
of
the
royal
dukes
if
not
in
england
then
here
on
the
continent
but
i
decided
you
see
godfrey
i
looked
into
everything
you
certainly
have
been
thorough
said
i
i
should
have
said
it
was
impossible
in
so
short
a
time
but
it
wasn
t
difficult
all
the
americans
over
here
are
well
informed
about
these
things
i
can
readily
believe
it
said
i
but
why
did
you
turn
down
the
poor
royal
dukes
because
the
other
women
would
have
made
it
dreadfully
uncomfortable
for
margot
they
d
have
hated
her
for
taking
precedence
over
them
by
such
a
long
distance
then
too
the
dowry
i
was
afraid
you
couldn
t
afford
the
dowry
or
wouldn
t
think
the
title
worth
the
money
indeed
i
didn
t
think
so
myself
a
royal
duke
comes
high
the
least
dowry
would
be
seventy
five
million
francs
fifteen
million
dollars
i
exclaimed
whew
mrs
sinkers
tried
to
get
one
for
her
daughter
for
ten
millions
all
she
could
scrape
together
they
agreed
to
a
morganatic
marriage
for
that
but
not
a
full
marriage
so
she
and
poor
martha
gave
it
up
martha
s
heart
is
broken
the
duke
made
love
to
her
so
wonderfully
i
can
t
imagine
what
mrs
sinkers
was
about
to
allow
such
a
thing
before
the
affair
was
settled
poor
martha
was
so
excited
that
she
would
have
accepted
the
morganatic
marriage
she
ranking
merely
as
the
duke
s
head
mistress
but
while
he
was
willing
to
take
other
mistresses
for
nothing
and
even
to
pay
them
he
wouldn
t
take
her
for
less
than
fifty
million
francs
poor
martha
said
i
i
was
too
wise
to
trifle
with
royal
dukes
pursued
edna
so
interested
in
her
own
narrative
and
so
eager
to
show
how
sagacious
she
had
been
that
she
forgot
her
pose
and
her
doubts
as
to
my
sympathies
i
weighed
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
about
a
dozen
eligible
men
only
three
stood
the
test
and
it
finally
narrowed
down
to
crossley
margot
was
so
happy
when
i
told
her
she
wanted
to
love
him
and
now
she
is
loving
him
a
long
pause
while
edna
calmed
down
to
earth
from
her
european
soarings
and
while
i
too
returned
to
the
normal
from
an
excursion
in
the
opposite
direction
how
much
does
he
want
said
i
let
s
get
to
bed
rock
he
loves
her
so
that
he
is
willing
so
i
hear
of
course
nothing
has
been
said
you
will
not
believe
how
refined
and
how
much
interrupted
i
edna
winced
at
my
rudeness
then
again
presented
an
unruffled
front
of
happy
loving
serenity
enough
to
pay
off
the
mortgages
and
to
provide
them
with
a
suitable
income
how
much
i
persisted
laughing
she
looked
tenderly
remonstrant
i
don
t
know
godfrey
you
know
about
how
much
what
s
the
figure
the
price
of
this
marked
down
marquis
i
should
say
the
whole
thing
would
not
cost
more
than
three
or
four
million
dollars
three
or
four
i
laughed
aloud
not
much
difference
there
now
which
is
it
three
or
four
perhaps
nearer
four
margot
must
have
a
good
income
to
be
sure
said
i
the
whole
object
would
be
defeated
if
she
hadn
t
the
means
the
money
i
suggested
why
use
these
evasive
words
we
re
talking
a
plain
subject
let
s
use
its
language
the
money
then
acquiesced
she
resolutely
good
humored
if
she
hadn
t
the
money
to
make
a
proper
appearance
naturally
to
lead
in
society
you
must
lead
in
spending
money
well
it
can
t
be
done
she
paled
half
started
from
her
chair
sank
back
again
there
was
a
long
silence
then
she
said
you
have
never
been
cruel
godfrey
you
won
t
be
cruel
now
you
won
t
destroy
my
life
work
you
won
t
shatter
margot
s
happiness
the
whole
thing
is
is
nauseating
to
me
said
i
her
short
pretty
upper
lip
quivered
her
eyes
filled
if
you
didn
t
approve
dear
why
didn
t
you
stop
me
long
ago
why
did
you
let
me
go
on
until
there
was
no
turning
back
i
was
silent
there
seemed
to
be
no
answer
to
that
did
you
do
it
purposely
godfrey
said
she
with
melancholy
eyes
upon
me
did
you
lure
us
on
so
that
you
could
crush
us
at
one
stroke
i
was
silent
i
can
t
believe
that
of
you
i
won
t
believe
it
until
you
compel
me
to
as
i
understand
it
said
i
you
propose
that
i
hand
over
to
this
young
man
four
million
only
about
half
of
it
godfrey
cried
she
reviving
the
other
half
would
be
margot
s
for
her
own
income
then
that
i
hand
over
to
this
amiable
insignificant
young
foreigner
two
million
dollars
to
induce
him
to
consent
to
the
degradation
of
marrying
my
daughter
to
have
him
going
about
saying
in
effect
it
is
true
she
is
only
one
of
those
low
americans
but
don
t
forget
that
i
got
two
million
dollars
for
stooping
is
that
the
proposition
you
know
it
isn
t
cried
she
he
doesn
t
feel
that
he
is
degrading
himself
he
feels
proud
of
winning
her
the
most
beautiful
the
best
mannered
girl
in
london
but
it
d
be
simply
impossible
for
them
to
marry
without
the
money
i
shouldn
t
want
it
they
would
be
wretched
you
talk
like
a
sentimental
schoolboy
godfrey
how
could
two
refined
sensitive
people
such
as
hugh
and
margot
used
to
every
luxury
used
to
being
foremost
in
society
how
could
they
be
happy
without
the
means
the
money
i
corrected
blandly
without
the
money
needed
to
maintain
their
position
as
marquis
and
marchioness
of
crossley
i
nodded
assent
he
has
only
about
five
thousand
twenty
five
thousand
of
our
money
a
year
that
is
ridiculous
for
a
marquis
he
has
to
keep
all
his
houses
closed
and
run
as
economically
as
possible
even
then
they
cost
him
nearly
seventy
five
thousand
dollars
a
year
to
maintain
and
he
has
only
twenty
five
thousand
i
meant
twenty
five
thousand
over
and
above
he
has
that
to
live
on
and
poor
fellow
he
is
dropping
every
year
deeper
and
deeper
into
debt
so
much
is
expected
of
a
marquis
but
not
honesty
apparently
said
i
you
mustn
t
judge
these
people
by
our
commercial
standards
she
gently
rebuked
i
forgot
said
i
penitently
and
the
poor
fellow
does
love
margot
so
um
said
i
have
you
ever
happened
to
hear
of
a
miss
townley
jupey
townley
a
flash
of
annoyance
flitted
over
edna
s
lovely
delicate
countenance
i
see
you
have
said
i
you
were
indeed
thorough
permit
me
to
compliment
you
my
dear
i
am
glad
hugh
hasn
t
been
a
saint
isn
t
said
i
that
s
all
in
the
past
declared
she
i
saw
them
in
a
box
at
a
london
music
hall
night
before
last
said
i
they
were
they
had
been
drinking
but
edna
was
not
daunted
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
godfrey
don
t
pretend
to
be
narrow
when
a
man
loves
a
woman
love
is
very
different
from
that
sort
of
thing
and
you
know
it
has
margot
heard
godfrey
cried
edna
in
horror
do
you
think
i
would
permit
my
daughter
our
daughter
to
know
such
things
why
her
mind
is
as
pure
i
could
not
restrain
a
gesture
of
disgust
you
women
i
cried
rising
pure
pure
god
in
heaven
pure
her
look
of
dazed
astonishment
obviously
sincere
helped
me
to
get
back
my
composure
i
sat
down
again
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
i
didn
t
mean
to
interrupt
even
if
you
men
have
no
purity
yourselves
you
ought
to
believe
in
it
in
women
said
she
with
an
injured
air
yes
indeed
i
agreed
heartily
i
congratulate
you
on
being
able
to
make
such
generous
allowances
for
masculine
frailty
you
are
sarcastic
said
she
coldly
no
matter
it
certainly
does
not
damage
the
title
perhaps
adds
to
its
luster
it
s
hereditary
in
their
family
to
be
wild
up
to
marriage
and
then
to
settle
down
and
serve
the
state
in
some
distinguished
position
oh
in
that
case
said
i
ironically
margot
and
her
husband
and
her
children
will
have
your
money
some
day
pursued
she
why
not
give
it
to
her
now
when
it
will
get
her
happiness
that
impressed
me
i
have
not
said
i
would
not
consent
to
this
marriage
i
reminded
her
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
m
in
favor
of
it
i
can
see
no
future
for
margot
in
america
no
indeed
cried
edna
eagerly
she
simply
couldn
t
marry
over
there
she
d
be
wretched
but
i
feel
it
is
my
duty
rather
late
in
the
day
for
me
to
talk
about
duty
toward
my
daughter
after
neglecting
it
all
these
years
still
i
ought
to
see
to
it
that
she
has
the
best
possible
chance
for
a
smooth
married
life
it
s
only
common
prudence
to
take
all
precautions
isn
t
it
all
sensible
precautions
said
she
you
know
how
many
of
these
foreign
alliances
as
they
re
called
have
turned
out
badly
they
get
a
good
many
divorces
in
the
states
she
suggested
smilingly
one
to
every
twelve
marriages
i
read
the
other
day
i
admitted
that
she
had
made
an
effective
retort
the
truth
is
said
i
american
women
aren
t
brought
up
for
domestic
life
so
whether
they
marry
at
home
or
abroad
they
have
trouble
men
resent
their
independence
said
edna
it
may
be
so
said
i
of
what
use
to
point
out
to
her
that
the
trouble
lay
in
the
women
s
demanding
to
be
supported
and
refusing
to
do
anything
to
earn
their
support
all
i
said
was
i
suspect
a
good
many
husbands
think
the
marriage
contract
too
one
sided
binding
only
them
and
not
their
wives
but
the
trouble
with
the
alliances
can
t
be
that
it
s
because
europeans
look
on
the
wife
as
a
kind
of
head
servant
but
hugh
isn
t
that
sort
we
ll
know
more
as
to
that
when
we
hear
what
margot
says
after
she
s
been
married
a
few
years
said
i
the
point
to
settle
now
is
how
to
bind
him
to
good
behavior
so
far
as
it
can
be
done
in
advance
he
may
be
deeply
in
love
with
margot
he
may
stay
in
love
with
her
but
in
the
circumstances
it
s
wise
to
assume
that
he
wants
only
her
money
and
that
if
he
gets
it
he
ll
treat
her
badly
my
wife
s
silence
was
encouraging
if
he
had
plenty
of
money
he
might
even
goad
her
into
releasing
him
and
might
marry
again
my
wife
was
obviously
impressed
yes
that
has
been
done
said
she
of
course
if
margot
should
have
an
heir
right
away
but
she
looked
at
me
as
if
trying
to
decide
whether
she
could
trust
me
with
a
confidence
she
evidently
decided
in
my
favor
for
she
went
on
to
say
on
the
other
hand
margot
is
a
peculiar
girl
no
many
women
have
the
same
peculiarity
they
can
t
be
trusted
with
power
over
their
husbands
if
she
had
all
the
money
in
her
own
name
and
he
were
dependent
on
her
godfrey
i
m
sure
there
d
be
trouble
once
more
she
was
astonishing
me
with
her
clear
judgment
in
matters
as
to
which
i
should
have
thought
her
hopelessly
prejudiced
but
i
can
be
trusted
said
i
the
plan
i
had
in
mind
was
to
take
over
the
mortgages
and
guarantee
a
sufficient
income
she
shook
her
head
he
won
t
consent
said
she
his
solicitors
will
insist
on
better
terms
than
that
now
you
see
why
i
want
to
talk
to
him
directly
i
don
t
purpose
to
be
hampered
by
that
old
trick
of
the
principal
hidden
behind
a
go
between
there
s
no
other
way
said
edna
they
re
too
clever
to
yield
that
he
needs
money
badly
but
he
won
t
marry
unless
he
s
actually
to
get
it
replied
she
almost
every
american
who
has
married
a
daughter
over
here
has
tried
to
make
a
business
bargain
at
least
a
bargain
not
altogether
one
sided
not
one
of
them
has
succeeded
these
europeans
have
been
handling
the
dowry
and
settlement
question
too
many
centuries
i
see
said
i
affably
if
we
want
what
they
ve
got
we
have
to
take
it
on
their
terms
it
was
most
satisfactory
talking
with
her
now
that
she
consented
to
speak
and
listen
to
good
sense
i
was
at
once
in
a
more
amiable
frame
of
mind
although
i
knew
she
had
descended
from
her
high
horse
only
because
she
was
shrewd
enough
to
see
it
was
the
one
way
to
get
me
to
do
as
she
wished
i
will
hide
behind
a
go
between
myself
said
i
any
english
lawyer
would
simply
play
into
the
hands
of
the
other
side
at
least
so
hilda
was
telling
me
is
she
happy
very
when
s
her
husband
coming
back
not
for
a
year
or
so
i
believe
lord
blankenship
cares
more
for
big
game
and
for
exploring
than
for
anything
else
an
ideal
marriage
said
i
she
brought
him
the
money
he
wanted
he
brought
her
the
title
she
wanted
and
they
don
t
annoy
each
other
he
devotes
himself
to
sport
she
to
society
these
aristocratic
people
with
their
simple
vulgar
wants
that
are
so
easily
gratified
how
they
are
to
be
envied
edna
was
observing
me
furtively
uneasily
i
pretended
not
to
notice
i
went
on
now
if
they
wanted
the
difficult
things
things
like
love
and
companionship
and
congeniality
they
might
be
wretched
when
a
child
cries
for
a
stick
of
candy
or
a
tinsel
covered
rattle
for
money
or
social
position
why
it
s
easily
pacified
but
if
it
cries
for
the
moon
and
the
stars
i
laughed
softly
enjoying
her
wonder
as
much
as
my
own
fancies
after
a
while
she
said
with
some
constraint
you
see
a
great
deal
of
armitage
we
console
each
other
said
i
with
mild
raillery
have
you
been
going
out
much
i
m
very
busy
in
one
of
your
letters
those
rare
little
notes
of
yours
you
are
cruelly
neglectful
godfrey
in
one
of
them
you
spoke
of
a
week
end
or
so
on
armitage
s
yacht
you
and
he
don
t
go
off
alone
oh
no
some
literary
and
artistic
people
usually
are
aboard
i
didn
t
know
you
cared
for
that
sort
they
re
interesting
enough
i
suppose
they
re
friends
of
mrs
kirkwood
s
pursued
edna
she
s
like
her
brother
affects
to
despise
fashionable
society
their
pretenses
always
amused
me
they
are
sincere
people
said
i
they
don
t
pretend
that
s
why
i
like
them
i
notice
that
armitage
belongs
to
every
fashionable
club
in
new
york
and
to
some
over
here
said
edna
with
a
smile
that
was
as
shrewd
as
her
observation
also
that
he
manages
to
find
time
to
appear
at
the
most
exclusive
parties
during
the
season
i
had
observed
this
same
peculiarity
while
i
refused
to
draw
from
it
the
inference
she
drew
and
was
undeniably
justified
in
drawing
i
had
been
tempted
to
do
so
it
irritated
me
to
see
her
finger
upon
the
weak
spot
in
armitage
s
profession
of
freedom
from
snobbishness
and
mary
kirkwood
pursued
edna
she
s
the
same
sort
of
fakir
only
being
a
woman
she
does
it
more
deceptively
than
he
she
goes
nowhere
said
i
but
she
revels
in
the
fact
that
she
could
go
anywhere
so
she
fooled
you
did
she
edna
laughed
merrily
at
my
ill
concealed
discomfiture
but
then
you
know
so
little
about
women
i
confess
i
ve
never
seen
in
her
the
least
sign
of
snobbishness
or
of
interest
in
fashionable
foolishness
said
i
with
what
i
flatter
myself
was
a
fair
attempt
at
the
impartial
air
that
in
itself
ought
to
have
opened
your
eyes
said
edna
whenever
you
see
anyone
dear
with
no
sign
of
a
weakness
that
everybody
in
the
world
has
you
may
be
sure
you
are
seeing
a
fraud
because
you
have
a
weakness
dear
said
i
as
pleasant
and
as
acid
as
she
you
must
not
imagine
it
is
universal
but
you
have
that
weakness
too
really
did
you
or
did
you
not
join
the
fashionable
clubs
armitage
put
you
up
at
i
had
to
laugh
at
myself
are
you
or
are
you
not
proud
of
the
fact
that
your
best
friend
armitage
is
a
fashionable
person
would
you
be
as
proud
of
him
if
he
were
only
welcome
in
middle
class
houses
i
m
ashamed
to
say
there
s
something
in
that
said
i
not
much
but
something
yet
you
believed
mary
kirkwood
ended
edna
i
thought
little
about
it
said
i
and
i
still
believe
that
she
is
sincere
that
she
has
no
snobbishness
in
her
you
like
her
so
far
as
i
know
her
yes
my
answer
was
an
attempt
to
meet
and
parry
a
suspicion
i
felt
in
edna
s
mind
and
it
was
fairly
successful
fairly
for
no
one
ever
yet
completely
dislodged
a
suspicion
we
cannot
see
into
each
other
s
minds
we
know
from
what
is
going
on
in
our
own
minds
that
the
human
mind
is
capable
of
any
vagary
once
we
have
applied
this
general
principle
to
a
specific
person
once
we
have
become
definitely
aware
that
there
are
in
that
person
s
mind
things
of
which
we
have
no
knowledge
from
that
time
forth
suspicion
of
them
is
in
us
and
is
ready
to
grow
to
flourish
i
had
no
difficulty
in
shifting
to
the
subject
of
the
marriage
i
ll
cable
for
my
lawyer
said
i
if
anyone
can
beat
this
game
fred
norman
can
yes
send
for
him
said
edna
he
is
canny
and
a
man
of
our
world
i
m
going
back
to
london
to
night
i
went
on
to
night
she
exclaimed
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
godfrey
is
this
treating
us
right
i
looked
at
her
intently
don
t
fake
with
me
said
i
quietly
it
isn
t
necessary
what
do
you
mean
cried
she
i
mean
i
understand
perfectly
that
you
care
nothing
about
me
except
as
the
source
of
the
money
you
need
in
amusing
yourself
as
you
see
in
my
manner
i
am
not
wildly
agitated
by
that
fact
so
far
as
i
m
concerned
there
s
no
reason
why
we
should
make
each
other
uncomfortable
what
is
the
matter
with
you
godfrey
she
said
with
large
widening
eyes
gazing
at
me
you
have
changed
entirely
as
you
have
said
i
admiring
her
shrewdness
and
afraid
of
it
you
ve
been
educating
so
have
i
mine
has
been
slower
than
yours
and
along
different
lines
but
it
too
has
been
thorough
she
was
not
satisfied
though
i
m
confident
my
tone
and
manner
betrayed
nothing
said
she
some
bad
woman
has
been
poisoning
you
against
margot
and
me
as
you
please
said
i
too
wary
to
be
drawn
into
that
discussion
i
realized
i
had
said
entirely
too
much
relying
upon
her
intense
vanity
her
profound
belief
in
her
power
over
me
i
had
gone
too
far
my
business
takes
me
to
london
to
night
i
ll
probably
be
there
until
norman
arrives
then
we
ll
come
over
don
t
you
want
us
in
london
with
you
said
edna
you
are
comfortably
settled
here
replied
i
why
disturb
yourselves
she
knew
how
to
read
me
she
saw
i
was
not
in
a
dangerous
mood
as
she
had
begun
to
fear
she
said
we
did
intend
to
stay
in
paris
a
month
or
six
weeks
we
have
a
charming
circle
of
friends
among
the
old
families
here
i
wish
you
d
stop
on
godfrey
the
people
are
attractive
and
the
social
life
is
most
interesting
not
to
me
said
i
you
forget
i
m
a
hooligan
besides
you
don
t
need
me
there
s
your
advantage
through
being
young
and
lovely
and
rich
you
can
get
plenty
of
men
to
escort
you
about
it
s
only
the
old
and
ugly
married
women
who
really
need
their
husbands
well
i
ll
be
ready
when
you
are
forced
to
fall
back
on
me
nothing
like
having
in
reserve
a
faithful
dobbin
she
looked
hurt
how
can
you
joke
about
sacred
things
she
reproached
i
laughed
her
seriousness
aside
yes
i
ll
be
waiting
ready
to
be
your
companion
the
confidant
of
your
rheumatism
and
gout
when
all
the
others
have
fled
meanwhile
my
dear
i
ll
have
my
frisk
godfrey
it
amused
me
to
see
how
bitter
to
her
was
the
taste
of
the
medicine
she
had
been
forcing
upon
me
so
self
complacently
it
amused
me
to
watch
the
confusion
into
which
these
new
and
unsuspected
aspects
of
myself
was
throwing
her
said
i
i
m
glad
you
re
as
generous
toward
me
as
i
ve
been
toward
you
that
s
why
we
ve
avoided
the
armitage
sort
of
smash
up
when
i
left
paris
that
night
i
ll
engage
she
was
thinking
about
me
as
she
had
never
thought
in
her
whole
self
centered
american
female
life
viii
my
cable
to
norman
was
answered
the
next
day
but
one
by
a
note
from
him
stopping
in
the
same
hotel
i
shall
not
detail
the
negotiations
that
followed
the
long
and
stormy
scenes
between
him
and
dawkins
solicitor
to
the
marquis
of
crossley
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
norman
had
the
novel
sensation
of
being
beaten
on
every
point
not
outwitted
for
he
had
wit
enough
and
to
spare
for
any
contest
of
cunning
but
beaten
by
the
centuries
old
precedents
and
customs
and
requirements
in
matters
of
dower
and
settlement
the
mercenary
marriage
is
an
ancient
habit
of
the
human
race
in
fact
the
scientists
have
proved
that
it
began
with
marriage
itself
that
there
was
no
marriage
in
the
civilized
sense
until
there
was
property
to
marry
for
perhaps
the
mercenary
marriage
is
not
so
recent
in
america
as
our
idyllists
declare
do
we
not
read
that
the
father
of
his
country
married
solely
for
money
an
almost
feeble
minded
woman
whom
everybody
knew
he
did
not
love
and
inasmuch
as
marriage
is
first
of
all
a
business
the
business
of
providing
for
the
material
needs
and
wants
of
two
and
their
children
may
it
not
barely
be
possible
that
the
unqualifiedly
sentimental
view
of
marriage
can
be
perhaps
has
been
overdone
in
america
where
the
marriage
for
sentiment
prevails
to
an
extent
unknown
anywhere
else
in
the
world
is
not
the
institution
of
marriage
there
in
its
most
uneasy
state
and
may
not
that
be
the
reason
what
a
world
of
twaddle
it
is
if
men
and
women
could
only
learn
to
build
their
ideals
on
the
firm
foundation
the
only
firm
foundation
of
the
practical
instead
of
upon
the
quicksand
of
lies
and
pretenses
wouldn
t
the
tower
climb
less
shakily
if
more
slowly
toward
the
stars
you
may
be
sure
there
was
nothing
of
the
stars
in
those
talks
between
norman
and
dawkins
or
in
my
talks
with
norman
or
in
crossley
s
talks
with
dawkins
crossley
had
had
me
looked
up
had
discovered
as
much
about
my
finances
as
it
is
possible
to
discover
about
the
private
business
of
an
american
he
had
got
the
usual
exaggerated
estimate
of
my
wealth
and
he
was
resolved
that
he
would
not
be
cheated
of
a
single
dollar
he
might
wring
from
me
from
my
standpoint
it
was
obvious
that
he
and
margot
must
have
plenty
of
money
or
they
could
not
be
happy
all
i
desired
was
to
prevent
him
from
feeling
financially
free
and
therefore
under
the
aristocratic
code
morally
free
to
show
and
to
act
after
marriage
the
contempt
i
knew
he
felt
for
all
things
and
persons
american
except
the
dollars
which
could
be
exchanged
into
sovereigns
i
fought
hard
but
he
stood
fast
either
margot
must
lose
him
or
i
must
give
him
about
what
he
asked
a
fortune
in
his
own
right
for
him
if
i
choose
i
could
dower
her
but
as
to
dowering
him
he
would
not
permit
the
question
of
alternative
to
be
raised
all
right
said
i
at
last
to
norman
give
them
their
minimum
he
was
astounded
was
furious
and
as
he
is
not
the
ordinary
lick
spittle
lawyer
but
a
man
of
arrogant
independence
he
did
not
hesitate
to
let
me
see
that
his
anger
and
scorn
were
for
myself
do
you
mean
that
he
said
yes
replied
i
carelessly
as
if
i
were
now
indifferent
about
the
whole
business
my
girl
wants
his
title
and
why
let
a
question
of
money
come
between
her
and
happiness
i
can
t
refrain
from
saying
loring
that
i
d
not
have
believed
this
of
you
she
s
not
fit
to
live
in
america
said
i
her
mother
hasn
t
educated
her
for
it
american
mothers
don
t
educate
their
daughters
nowadays
to
be
wives
of
american
men
honestly
do
you
know
an
american
man
able
to
do
for
himself
who
would
be
foolish
enough
to
marry
that
sort
of
girl
his
silence
was
assent
you
see
i
ve
got
to
buy
her
a
husband
that
is
a
title
over
here
this
offering
seems
as
good
as
there
is
in
the
market
at
the
price
so
why
not
that
s
one
view
of
it
said
he
coldly
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
come
now
be
sensible
said
i
what
else
can
i
do
it
would
be
an
impertinence
for
me
to
say
replied
he
i
can
guess
said
i
you
needn
t
trouble
yourself
to
say
it
you
evidently
don
t
know
the
circumstances
and
i
may
add
that
so
long
as
i
ve
got
to
buy
margot
a
title
i
might
as
well
buy
her
a
good
one
he
eyed
me
sharply
but
i
did
not
take
him
into
my
confidence
nor
shall
i
confide
in
you
at
present
gentle
reader
i
did
not
even
let
him
see
that
i
was
holding
back
anything
i
went
on
with
good
humored
raillery
i
m
doing
better
than
hanley
or
vanderveld
or
pattison
or
any
of
the
others
who
ve
dealt
in
these
markets
for
a
marquis
crossley

selling
cheap
he
s
far
from
penniless
you
know
it
s
simply
that
he
wants
more
money
why
really
old
man
it
s
what
s
called
a
love
match
they
always
call
it
a
love
match
when
the
nobleman
isn
t
absolutely
on
his
uppers
you
are
certainly
a
philosopher
loring
said
norman
anxious
i
saw
to
finish
and
drop
the
affair
and
i
became
one
in
the
usual
way
necessity
said
i
i
m
as
eager
to
have
this
thing
dispatched
as
you
are
i
want
to
get
out
to
sea
where
perhaps
the
stench
of
aristocracy
will
blow
out
of
my
nostrils
and
stay
out
of
them
till
i
reach
the
other
shore
then
i
ll
get
it
again

down
the
bay
to

the
incoming
ships
yes
we
re
pretty
bad
admitted
norman
not
so
bad
as
we
used
to
be
but
pretty
bad
he
laughed
they
accuse
us
of
loving
money
why
we
are
mere
beginners
at
it
we
haven
t
learned
how
to
idle
or
how
to
spend
money
except
in
crude
tiresome
ways

to

money
deeply
you
must

how

more
dearly
no

concerned

what
a
bargain
i
had
got
you
may
be
picturing
a
sordid
affair
redolent
of
the
stenches
of
commercialism
if
you
are
gentle
reader
you
are
showing
yourself
unworthy
of
your
own
soulfulness
unworthy
of
the
elegant
society
into
which
i
have
introduced
you
i
have
been
giving
simply
the
plain
facts
a
mere
skeleton
upon
which
you
versed
in
society
columns
and
society
novels
and
skilled
in
the
art
of
hiding
ugly
truths
under
pretty
lies
may
readily
drape
the
flesh
and
the
garments
of
sentimentality
and
snobbishness
you
will
then
have
the
truth
as
it
appeared
to
the
world
a
handsome
manly
groom
every
inch
of
him
the
patrician
a
wondrous
lovely
innocent
pure
young
bride
looking
the
worthy
mate
of
the
great
noble
she
had
won
with
her
beauty
and
her
sweetness
a
background
of
magnificent
houses
and
equipages
of
grand
society
people
of
lackeys
in
livery
without
number
an
atmosphere
of
luxury
refinement
perfumed
with
the
fairest
flowers
and
the
most
delicate
artificial
scents
you
are
seeing
also
the
high
and
noble
motives
of
all
concerned
the
joy
of
parents
in
a
daughter
sentimentally
wooed
and
won
to
happiness
the
generous
and
kindly
feelings
of
all
the
friends
the
lavish
and
affectionate
overflowing
of
costly
gifts
above
all
the
ecstatic
young
couple
wrapped
up
in
their
love
for
each
other
flesh
up
and
beautify
the
skeleton
to
your
taste
gentle
reader
you
will
not
go
amiss
i
must
linger
a
moment
on
the
happiness
of
my
daughter
it
was
too
spiritual
to
be
of
this
earth
as
soon
as
the
miserable
unimportant
money
matters
were
settled
and
her
mother
gave
her
full
leave
to
love
she
threw
herself
into
it
with
all
the
ardor
of
the
heroine
of
a
novel
she
had
two
diamond
hearts
made
at
the
most
fashionable
jewelers
in
paris
you
may
be
sure
upon
the
inside
of
the
one
she
kept
she
had
engraved
under
his
picture
from
hugh
to
margot
in
the
one
she
gave
him
there
surrounded
her
picture
in
diamond
inlay
to
hugh
from
his
dear
love
margot
each
was
to
wear
the
heart
round
the
neck
until
death
again
and
again
i
caught
her
dreaming
over
hers
sometimes
with
tears
in
her
limpid
eyes
again
and
again
i
caught
her
scribbling
margot
marchioness
of
crossley
viscountess
brear
countess
of
felday
and
noth
baroness
de
selve
and
so
on
through
a
list
of
titles
which
gentle
reader
will
find
in
burke
s
and
the
almanach
de
gotha
and
she
had
a
reverent
way
of
looking
at
him
and
a
tender
way
of
touching
him
her
mother
you
will
believe
spared
neither
expense
nor
pains
in
getting
together
the
trousseau
but
margot
was
not
satisfied
not
nearly
fine
enough
for
his
bride
she
would
say
i
m
so
afraid
he
ll
be
disappointed
then
the
tears
would
spring
oh
mamma
if
he
should
be
disappointed
in
me
not
so
bad
as
if
you
were
to
be
disappointed
in
him
i
put
in
with
no
other
motive
than
to
cheer
her
up
but
it
only
shocked
her
in
hugh
she
exclaimed
meaning
in
cecil
robert
grunleigh
percival
hugh
massingford
marquis
of
crossley
etc
i
disappointed
in
him
oh
papa
you
don
t
realize
no
i
suppose
not
said
i
getting
myself
away
as
speedily
as
my
legs
would
carry
me
through
these
joyous
scenes
of
youth
and
love
and
luxury
i
moved
gloomily
restless
bitter
tormented
by
self
reproaches
and
by
thoughts
of
the
woman
i
loved
what
edna
had
said
about
her
though
i
knew
it
was
by
way
of
precautionary
cattishness
put
into
my
mind
the
inevitable
suspicion
no
not
actual
suspicion
but
germ
of
suspicion
the
almost
harmless
germ
from
which
the
most
poisonous
suspicions
may
develop
i
went
round
and
round
my
mental
image
of
mary
kirkwood
i
viewed
it
from
all
angles
but
i
could
not
find
a
trace
of
the
flaw
edna
had
asserted
i
analyzed
her
with
all
the
analytical
skill
i
possessed
and
that
i
flatter
myself
is
not
a
little
no
one
who
has
not
the
faculty
of
analysis
ever
gets
anywhere
no
one
who
has
that
faculty
ever
escapes
the
charge
of
cynicism
shallow
people
the
sort
that
make
such
a
charge
will
regard
it
as
proof
of
my
utter
cynicism
my
absolute
lack
of
sentiment
that
i
was
able
to
analyze
the
woman
i
loved
or
pretended
i
loved
but
i
assure
you
gentle
reader
that
not
even
love
and
passion
suspend
the
habitual
processes
of
a
good
mind
the
reason
you
have
read
the
contrary
so
often
is
because
precious
few
writers
about
men
of
the
superior
sort
have
the
capacity
to
comprehend
the
intellects
they
try
to
picture
to
the
man
of
large
affairs
the
average
and
many
a
one
above
the
average
biography
or
novel
about
a
great
man
reads
like
the
attempt
of
a
straddle
bug
to
give
his
fellow
straddle
bugs
an
account
of
an
elephant
i
was
the
only
inharmonious
figure
in
that
round
of
festivals
but
no
one
observed
me
i
simply
got
the
reputation
of
being
a
man
of
reserve
a
thinker
rather
than
a
talker
as
if
there
ever
lived
a
thinker
who
did
not
overflow
with
torrents
of
talk
like
a
spring
fed
from
a
glacier
but
of
course
the
spring
flows
only
when
the
conditions
are
favorable
not
when
it
is
ice
bound
i
was
not
even
interested
in
observing
there
is
a
monotony
about
the
actions
of
fashionable
people
that
soon
reduces
a
spectator
of
agile
mind
to
stupor
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
with
variations
so
slight
that
only
a
nit
wit
would
be
interested
in
them
could
there
be
a
worse
indictment
of
the
intelligence
of
the
human
race
than
that
so
large
a
part
of
its
presumably
most
intelligent
classes
engage
in
the
social
farce
which
is
an
example
of
aimless
activity
about
on
a
level
with
a
dog
s
chasing
its
own
tail
but
edna
as
i
look
back
on
those
weeks
of
days
each
one
crowded
like
a
ragbag
with
rubbish
the
figure
of
edna
stands
out
radiant
you
would
never
have
thought
her
the
mother
of
the
bride
or
indeed
a
mother
at
all
a
woman
who
for
many
years
leads
a
virginal
or
almost
virginal
life
gets
back
the
vestal
air
of
the
unmarried
girl
this
air
had
returned
to
edna
she
had
it
as
markedly
as
had
margot
it
was
most
becoming
to
her
piquant
style
of
beauty
giving
it
the
allure
of
the
height
that
invites
ascent
and
capture
yet
has
never
been
desecrated
and
how
she
did
enjoy
the
grandeur
the
great
names
the
gorgeous
presents
of
curiously
and
costlily
wrought
gold
and
silver
and
crystal
and
precious
stones
the
succession
of
panoramas
of
ultra
fashionable
life
with
herself
and
margot
always
the
center
i
used
to
stand
aside
and
watch
her
and
feel
as
if
i
were
hypnotized
into
vivid
hallucinations
i
recalled
the
incidents
of
our
early
life
brooklyn
the
passaic
flat
the
squat
and
squalid
homes
of
our
childhood
i
recalled
our
people
hers
and
mine
tucked
away
in
homely
obscurity
among
the
new
jersey
hills
but
by
no
effort
of
mind
could
i
associate
her
with
these
realities
she
had
literally
been
born
again
i
looked
at
the
other
americans
of
humble
beginnings
and
there
were
not
a
few
of
them
in
that
society
all
had
retained
some
traces
of
their
origin
had
some
characteristics
that
made
it
not
difficult
to
connect
their
present
with
their
past
but
not
edna
at
the
wedding
in
the
most
fashionable
church
in
the
west
end
margot
looked
weary
and
rather
old
gone
slightly
stale
from
too
long
and
hard
preliminary
training
edna
was
at
her
best
delicate
fragile
radiant
how
the
other
women
hated
her
for
that
time
defying
beauty
of
hers
many
of
the
women
of
her
still
youthful
age
retained
much
of
the
physical
attractiveness
of
youth
but
there
was
not
another
one
who
was
not
beginning
to
show
the
effects
of
dissipation
of
too
much
food
and
wine
and
cigarettes
of
lives
devoid
of
elevating
sensations
of
minds
used
only
for
petty
mean
thoughts
but
edna
seemed
in
the
flower
of
that
period
when
the
secrets
of
the
soul
have
as
yet
made
no
marks
upon
the
countenance
you
would
have
said
she
was
a
merry
and
romantic
girl
i
could
not
fathom
that
mystery
i
cannot
fathom
it
now
its
clew
must
be
in
her
truly
amazing
powers
of
self
deception
and
also
in
that
unique
capacity
of
hers
for
forgetting
the
thing
no
matter
what
that
is
disagreeable
to
remember
when
we
were
at
last
alone
with
the
young
couple
off
for
the
yacht
lord
shangway
had
loaned
them
for
the
honeymoon
with
the
last
guest
gone
and
the
last
powdered
flunkey
vanished
when
she
and
i
were
alone
she
settled
herself
with
a
sigh
and
said
i
wish
i
could
make
it
begin
all
over
again
you
must
be
built
of
steel
said
i
i
am
supremely
happy
said
she
and
have
been
for
weeks
nothing
agrees
with
me
so
thoroughly
as
happiness
i
looked
at
her
scrutinizingly
no
she
was
not
the
least
tired
she
was
as
fresh
as
if
that
moment
risen
from
a
long
sleep
in
the
air
of
seashore
or
mountains
she
went
on
i
m
going
over
to
paris
to
morrow
i
ve
a
lot
of
engagements
there
and
i
must
get
some
clothes
i
ve
worn
out
all
i
brought
with
me
worn
out
meant
worn
once
or
at
most
twice
for
in
a
society
where
everyone
is
seeing
everyone
else
all
the
time
a
woman
with
a
reputation
for
dress
cannot
afford
to
reappear
in
clothes
once
seen
in
some
circles
this
would
sound
delightfully
prodigal
in
others
delightfully
impossible
and
perhaps
in
still
others
delightfully
criminal
but
then
all
that
sort
of
thing
is
relative
like
everything
else
in
the
world
won
t
you
come
along
said
she
in
a
perfunctory
tone
no
thanks
i
replied
i
m
off
for
russia
with
a
party
of
bankers
to
look
at
some
mining
properties
i
thought
you
were
returning
to
new
york
not
for
several
months
said
i
how
can
you
stay
away
so
long
from
your
beloved
america
business
always
business
she
eyed
me
somewhat
as
one
eyes
a
strange
mildly
interesting
specimen
well
you
must
enjoy
it
or
you
wouldn
t
keep
at
it
year
in
and
year
out
one
has
to
pass
the
time
said
i
how
does
mary
kirkwood
pass
the
time
this
unexpected
and
except
sub
consciously
accidental
question
staggered
me
for
an
instant
i
don
t
know
much
about
it
said
i
she
has
a
house
and
she
looks
after
it
herself
she
reads
i
believe
she
has
gardens
and
they
use
up
a
lot
of
time
then
she
rides
edna
yawned
it
sounds
dull
she
said
but
domestic
people
are
always
dull
and
she
is
certainly
domestic
i
wonder
why
she
doesn
t
marry
again
i
was
silent
are
any
men
attentive
to
her
it
seems
to
me
i
heard
something
about
a
novelist
some
poor
man
who
is
after
her
money
i
was
choking
with
rage
and
jealousy
did
you
see
any
such
man
about
i
contrived
to
compose
myself
for
a
calm
reply
no
one
answering
to
your
description
said
i
do
you
like
her
you
asked
me
that
once
before
said
i
oh
i
forgot
it
seems
to
me
you
and
she
would
have
exactly
suited
each
other
you
like
domestic
women
that
is
you
think
you
do
really
you
d
probably
fly
from
a
woman
of
that
sort
and
a
woman
of
the
other
sort
would
fly
from
me
said
i
laughing
she
looked
at
me
thoughtfully
you
must
admit
you
re
not
easy
to
get
on
with
except
at
a
distance
observed
she
but
men
of
positive
individuality
are
never
easy
to
get
on
with
a
big
tree
blights
all
the
little
trees
and
bushes
that
try
to
grow
in
its
neighborhood
no
godfrey
dear
you
weren
t
made
for
domestic
life
you
and
i
domestic
life
is
successful
only
where
there
are
two
very
small
and
very
much
alike
people
like
us
have
to
live
alone
i
rose
abruptly
there
was
for
me
a
sound
in
that
alone
like
the
slam
of
a
graveyard
gate
you
never
will
appreciate
me
how
satisfactory
i
ve
been
she
went
on
until
you
marry
again
i
must
make
my
final
arrangements
for
russia
said
i
shall
i
see
you
in
the
morning
i
m
leaving
rather
early
probably
not
said
i
then
we
ll
meet
when
you
come
back
we
ll
visit
margot
at
sothewell
abbey
she
rose
drew
herself
to
her
full
height
with
a
graceful
gesture
of
triumph
don
t
you
honestly
rather
like
it
being
the
father
of
a
marchioness
i
could
not
speak
i
looked
at
her
how
solemn
you
are
laughed
she
well
good
by
dear
and
she
held
out
her
hand
and
turned
her
face
upward
for
me
to
kiss
her
lips
oh
i
ll
probably
see
you
in
the
morning
i
said
or
to
night
and
away
i
went
from
russia
i
drifted
to
india
intending
to
return
home
by
the
pacific
at
bombay
i
met
lord
blankenship
and
he
persuaded
me
to
cross
to
east
africa
i
found
him
a
companion
exactly
to
my
taste
he
was
a
silent
chap
having
nothing
to
think
about
and
nothing
to
think
with
a
typical
and
model
product
of
the
aristocratic
education
that
completes
a
man
as
a
sculptor
completes
an
image
and
prepares
him
to
stand
in
his
appointed
niche
until
decay
tumbles
him
down
as
rubbish
i
had
lost
all
my
former
passion
for
talking
and
listening
i
wished
to
confine
myself
my
thoughts
to
the
trivial
matters
of
the
senses
to
lingering
over
and
tinkering
with
the
physical
details
of
life
the
silent
and
vacant
blankenship
set
me
a
perfect
example
one
easy
to
fall
into
the
habit
of
following
at
paris
i
picked
up
my
private
secretary
markham
and
resumed
attention
to
my
affairs
i
had
arranged
for
things
to
go
on
without
me
when
i
set
out
for
east
africa
i
found
that
my
guess
as
to
how
they
would
go
had
been
correct
for
a
month
or
so
there
was
confusion
the
confusion
that
is
inevitable
when
a
man
who
has
attended
to
everything
abruptly
throws
up
his
leadership
then
the
affairs
in
which
he
fancied
himself
indispensable
begin
to
move
as
well
as
if
he
were
at
the
throttle
perhaps
better
the
most
substantial
result
of
my
neglect
seemed
to
be
that
i
had
become
much
richer
had
more
than
recovered
what
my
purchase
of
a
son
in
law
had
cost
me
markham
who
had
been
at
cairo
two
months
had
got
himself
engaged
to
be
married
for
several
years
i
had
been
promising
him
a
good
position
that
is
to
say
one
more
fitting
a
grown
man
of
real
capacity
but
he
made
himself
so
useful
that
i
put
off
redeeming
my
promise
and
eased
my
conscience
and
quieted
his
ambition
with
a
succession
of
increases
of
salary
now
however
i
could
no
longer
delay
releasing
him
so
i
must
go
back
to
new
york
to
find
some
one
to
take
his
place
blankenship
was
wavering
between
a
trip
through
west
africa
and
going
to
america
with
me
on
the
chance
of
my
accompanying
him
on
a
shooting
trip
through
british
columbia
he
decided
to
stick
to
me
and
as
i
had
grown
thoroughly
used
to
having
him
about
i
was
rather
glad
it
is
astonishing
how
much
comfort
one
can
get
out
of
the
society
of
a
silent
man
when
one
feels
that
he
is
a
good
fellow
and
a
devoted
friend
i
telegraphed
edna
that
i
would
be
unable
to
come
to
london
where
she
then
was
but
she
defeated
my
plan
for
not
seeing
her
when
i
reached
paris
there
she
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
ritz
she
had
a
swarm
of
french
italians
and
english
about
her
i
believe
there
were
some
germans
or
austrians
also
i
refused
to
be
annoyed
with
them
and
we
dined
quietly
with
blankenship
markham
and
a
pretty
little
countess
de
salevac
to
act
us
buffers
between
us
i
tried
to
avoid
being
left
alone
with
her
but
she
would
not
have
it
so
she
insisted
on
my
coming
to
her
sitting
room
after
the
others
had
gone
i
know
you
are
tired
said
she
but
i
shan
t
detain
you
long
please
don
t
said
i
the
journey
has
knocked
me
out
i
ve
not
slept
for
two
nights
it
s
a
shame
to
worry
you
i
made
for
the
door
not
to
night
no
worries
they
ll
keep
until
to
morrow
no
godfrey
dear
she
said
i
must
tell
you
at
once
there
is
serious
trouble
between
margot
and
hugh
why
they
haven
t
been
married
a
year
he
has
been
treating
her
shamefully
from
the
outset
in
fact
he
cut
short
the
honeymoon
to
hurry
back
to
that
music
hall
person
the
one
i
saw
him
with
yes
the
same
one
that
notorious
jupey
what
s
her
name
isn
t
it
dreadful
margot
s
pride
is
up
in
arms
nothing
i
say
will
quiet
her
um
said
i
she
refuses
to
understand
that
over
here
husbands
are
allowed
a
a
latitude
i
suggested
more
latitude
than
in
america
i
have
talked
with
hugh
too
he
is
very
difficult
really
he
isn
t
at
all
as
he
seemed
he
is
a
he
is
horribly
coarse
people
who
think
of
nothing
but
how
to
get
money
without
work
and
how
to
spend
it
without
usefulness
are
apt
to
be
coarse
when
you
probe
through
to
the
reality
of
them
he
is
defiant
pursued
she
too
femininely
practical
to
have
interest
in
or
patience
with
philosophy
he
godfrey
he
says
he
hates
her
he
won
t
speak
to
her
and
there
s
no
prospect
of
an
heir
he
says
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
her
these
successive
admissions
of
a
worse
and
worse
mess
were
forced
from
her
by
my
air
of
indifference
what
has
she
done
i
asked
done
i
don
t
understand
what
has
she
done
to
drive
him
to
extremes
godfrey
she
cried
in
a
shocked
tone
you
taking
sides
against
your
daughter
your
only
child
have
you
no
paternal
feeling
either
not
much
said
i
you
see
i
ve
seen
little
of
margot
not
enough
to
get
acquainted
with
her
and
you
educated
her
so
that
we
are
uncongenial
no
since
you
set
me
to
thinking
i
find
i
haven
t
much
paternal
feeling
for
her
i
used
to
have
in
passaic
when
i
wheeled
her
about
the
streets
on
sundays
i
paused
to
enjoy
the
shame
my
wife
was
struggling
with
but
soon
after
we
moved
to
brooklyn
edna
winced
and
shivered
you
sent
her
away
to
begin
to
be
a
lady
and
a
lady
she
is
and
ladies
are
not
daughters
are
not
women
even
you
must
help
me
godfrey
said
edna
after
a
strained
silence
margot
is
wretched
and
a
dreadful
scandal
may
break
out
in
time
already
people
are
talking
margot
is
ashamed
to
show
herself
in
public
she
thinks
everyone
is
laughing
at
her
no
doubt
she
s
right
said
i
a
woman
who
loses
her
husband
on
the
honeymoon
is
likely
to
be
laughed
at
what
did
she
do
why
do
you
persist
in
saying
that
cried
she
so
irritated
that
she
could
not
altogether
restrain
herself
your
dislike
of
women
has
become
a
mania
with
you
but
i
don
t
dislike
them
replied
i
on
the
contrary
i
like
them
like
them
so
well
that
their
worthlessness
angers
me
like
the
treachery
of
a
friend
and
i
believe
so
much
in
their
power
that
when
things
go
wrong
i
blame
them
they
have
dominion
over
the
men
and
over
the
children
and
whenever
they
use
their
powers
it
is
to
make
fools
of
the
men
and
weaklings
of
the
children
i
don
t
know
which
is
the
worse
influence
the
wishy
washy
unpractical
preacher
morality
of
the
good
woman
or
the
lazy
idle
irresponsible
dissipation
of
the
the
ladies
and
near
ladies
and
lady
climbers
and
lady
imitators
but
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
poor
margot
exclaimed
she
impatiently
everything
to
do
with
her
replied
i
still
it
s
a
spilt
pail
of
milk
as
for
the
present
and
future
how
can
i
do
anything
to
help
her
you
can
t
if
you
condemn
her
unheard
i
don
t
condemn
her
i
am
simply
recognizing
that
there
are
two
sides
to
this
quarrel
and
i
assure
you
you
only
make
matters
worse
when
you
interfere
without
recognizing
that
fact
so
i
say
again
what
did
she
do
my
wife
calmed
slightly
and
replied
he
says
she
made
him
ridiculous
with
the
airs
she
put
on
i
laughed
after
the
education
you
gave
her
that
s
right
blame
me
and
aren
t
you
to
be
blamed
urged
i
didn
t
you
have
full
charge
of
her
from
the
time
she
was
born
couldn
t
you
have
made
what
you
pleased
of
her
didn
t
you
make
what
you
pleased
of
her
edna
tossed
her
head
indignantly
i
never
taught
her
to
be
a
vulgar
snob
why
i
thought
that
was
her
whole
education
edna
ignored
this
interruption
it
s
all
very
well
for
the
women
of
noble
families
to
act
the
snob
pursued
she
lots
of
them
do
and
no
one
criticises
but
margot
ought
to
have
had
sense
enough
to
realize
that
she
a
mere
american
couldn
t
afford
to
do
it
i
warned
her
that
her
cue
was
sweetness
and
an
air
of
equality
i
told
her
that
her
title
in
itself
would
keep
people
at
their
proper
distance
but
she
lost
her
head
then
the
thing
for
her
to
do
is
to
behave
herself
it
s
too
late
i
m
afraid
the
tide
has
turned
against
her
all
the
women
especially
the
titled
english
women
of
good
family
were
against
her
hated
her
were
ready
to
stab
her
in
the
back
and
her
haughtiness
and
condescension
gave
them
the
chance
well
what
do
you
propose
to
give
him
more
money
edna
showed
none
of
her
familiar
scorn
of
sordid
things
she
reflected
said
uncertainly
i
wonder
would
that
do
any
good
to
win
anyone
give
them
what
they
most
want
said
i
what
do
your
friends
over
here
want
above
everything
and
anything
perhaps
you
are
right
confessed
she
consider
gentle
reader
what
this
confession
involved
how
it
exposed
the
rotten
insincerity
of
all
her
and
her
fine
friends
pretenses
yes
i
guess
you
re
right
godfrey
she
pressed
her
hands
to
her
temples
it
simply
must
be
straightened
out
i
am
quite
distracted
i
can
t
afford
to
lose
sleep
and
to
be
harrowed
up
those
things
mean
ruin
to
a
woman
s
looks
and
what
would
i
do
if
she
were
flung
back
on
my
hands
in
this
disgraceful
fashion
you
want
me
to
go
to
london
godfrey
you
must
go
you
must
see
her
and
him
too
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
enough
to
see
him
but
perhaps
you
re
right
she
is
clean
mad
cried
edna
with
sudden
fury
against
her
daughter
she
doesn
t
appreciate
the
peril
of
her
position
one
minute
she
s
all
for
groveling
the
next
she
talks
like
an
idiot
about
her
rank
and
power
oh
she
is
a
fool
a
fool
i
always
knew
she
was
though
i
wouldn
t
admit
it
to
myself
you
never
will
know
what
a
time
i
ve
had
training
her
to
hide
it
enough
to
make
a
pleasing
appearance
she
is
a
brainless
fool
a
fool
but
not
brainless
said
i
her
education
made
her
a
fool
and
paralyzed
her
brain
you
see
she
didn
t
have
the
advantages
you
had
in
your
early
training
in
your
early
days
you
had
the
chance
to
learn
something
the
useful
things
that
have
saved
you
from
the
consequences
of
such
folly
as
you
ve
taught
her
what
nonsense
cried
edna
in
disgust
but
we
mustn
t
quarrel
i
m
agitated
enough
already
you
will
go
to
london
yes
said
i
after
reflecting
i
ll
go
when
to
morrow
and
i
ll
go
with
you
no
said
i
firmly
either
i
manage
this
affair
alone
or
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
godfrey
there
are
so
many
things
about
these
people
that
you
don
t
understand
and
you
i
understand
the
essential
thing
said
i
and
that
is
their
mania
for
money
she
was
on
the
verge
of
hysteria
afraid
i
would
not
go
afraid
of
what
i
would
do
if
i
did
go
but
they
have
to
be
handled
carefully
she
urged
if
you
put
them
in
a
position
where
their
pride
won
t
let
them
take
the
the
money
trust
me
said
i
go
to
bed
sleep
soundly
and
trust
me
i
stood
she
suddenly
flung
herself
against
my
breast
and
began
to
sob
on
my
shoulder
you
are
hard
and
cold
she
said
you
have
no
sympathy
with
me
no
feeling
for
anything
but
business
but
somehow
in
spite
of
it
all
i
have
such
a
sense
of
your
strength
and
your
honesty
i
laughed
rather
awkwardly
patted
her
shoulder
helped
her
to
a
chair
there
are
times
when
a
coarse
common
american
business
man
of
a
husband
has
his
uses
and
advantages
i
said
lightly
i
ll
telegraph
you
how
things
are
going
she
dried
her
eyes
looked
at
me
in
a
puzzled
way
you
always
repulse
me
she
said
i
appreciate
your
kindness
in
remembering
to
toss
a
few
crumbs
to
the
starving
man
laughed
i
they
are
precious
crumbs
no
doubt
and
more
than
he
deserves
but
please
don
t
do
it
he
hates
that
sort
of
thing
you
are
free
to
act
as
you
feel
like
acting
i
ll
do
as
much
for
you
and
margot
without
the
crumbs
as
with
them
how
hard
you
are
godfrey
how
you
have
always
misunderstood
me
that
s
right
said
i
amiably
i
m
too
coarse
for
such
a
fine
nature
well
good
night
i
took
myself
hastily
away
to
bed
and
at
ten
the
next
morning
i
departed
for
london
i
decided
to
see
margot
first
she
was
at
sothewell
abbey
about
an
hour
by
express
from
paddington
you
perhaps
know
sothewell
abbey
through
the
pictures
and
descriptions
and
it
is
indeed
an
imposing
pile
of
old
masonry
seated
in
the
midst
of
a
park
of
surpassing
beauty
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
ancient
gates
for
the
two
mile
drive
to
the
abbey
i
saw
signs
that
my
money
was
in
action
when
i
first
visited
it
the
lodge
was
in
sad
disrepair
the
gates
were
about
to
fall
to
pieces
and
the
vista
of
the
drive
was
unkempt
now
all
was
changed
the
servile
pair
who
came
out
to
open
for
me
and
made
me
fear
they
would
drop
down
on
their
bellies
and
crawl
before
me
were
neatly
and
properly
dressed
in
strong
contrast
to
their
former
appearance
the
exterior
of
the
house
which
had
been
most
romantic
but
obviously
the
front
of
poverty
and
decay
looked
much
better
not
younger
i
hasten
to
assure
you
quiet
reader
but
somewhat
like
a
hairless
toothless
old
man
when
he
gets
a
nice
white
wig
on
his
pate
and
a
set
of
good
false
teeth
on
his
shriveled
gums
i
saw
gardeners
at
work
and
plenty
there
was
for
them
to
do
within
i
saw
evidences
of
a
more
adequate
staff
of
servants
but
the
great
halls
were
dreary
and
bare
and
dingy
that
was
a
cold
summer
in
england
even
colder
than
the
summer
usually
is
so
the
enormous
house
was
literally
uninhabitable
like
all
the
european
palaces
city
and
country
that
i
have
been
in
i
can
fancy
what
such
a
place
must
be
in
winter
with
no
way
of
heating
it
but
open
fireplaces
and
not
many
of
them
i
can
t
conceive
any
sane
american
used
to
comfort
in
the
way
of
steam
heat
spending
a
winter
in
the
english
country
i
know
it
is
done
by
americans
reputedly
sane
but
if
those
at
home
knew
what
europe
in
winter
meant
the
old
fashioned
romantic
europe
they
would
not
believe
their
expatriated
countrymen
sane
in
sacrificing
comfort
and
health
to
vanity
yes
i
believe
they
would
for
do
not
they
at
home
make
the
same
imbecile
sacrifices
to
vanity
in
other
ways
take
me
to
some
small
warm
room
said
i
to
margot
before
i
catch
my
death
of
cold
this
the
instant
i
was
within
doors
and
felt
in
my
very
marrow
the
clammy
chill
of
that
picturesque
vaulted
hall
there
isn
t
any
warm
room
in
the
house
replied
she
how
about
the
kitchen
said
i
she
looked
alarmed
being
her
mother
s
own
daughter
in
lack
of
the
sense
of
humor
as
in
many
other
ways
she
said
hastily
the
upstairs
rooms
are
a
little
better
they
couldn
t
be
worse
these
rooms
are
cold
storage
i
m
getting
used
to
it
said
she
one
doesn
t
mind
it
so
much
after
a
while
her
nose
was
red
and
swollen
and
her
voice
husky
she
had
a
frightful
cold
at
that
very
moment
why
don
t
you
get
out
of
here
and
go
to
a
decent
modern
hotel
in
town
said
i
give
up
possession
cried
she
in
horror
he
might
not
let
me
come
back
it
was
too
ridiculous
possession
of
what
said
i
oh
papa
cried
she
in
despair
and
shame
at
my
coarse
stupidity
possession
of
what
i
repeated
of
a
dirty
dingy
old
cold
storage
plant
why
should
you
want
to
come
back
put
on
your
wraps
and
let
s
fly
to
town
by
the
next
train
she
burst
into
tears
i
d
rather
die
she
sobbed
i
won
t
give
up
my
position
i
am
marchioness
of
crossley
and
i
belong
here
all
right
said
i
let
s
try
the
smaller
rooms
she
led
me
up
a
vast
stairway
it
would
have
thrilled
your
soul
gentle
reader
think
how
it
sounds
put
into
the
fitting
language
the
beautiful
young
marchioness
conducted
her
father
up
the
ancient
and
magnificent
stairway
that
rose
from
the
spacious
medi
val
hall
and
swept
in
a
curve
of
wonderfully
wrought
stone
work
dating
from
the
thirteenth
century
to
the
upper
chambers
of
the
majestic
old
abbey
i
hurried
her
as
fast
as
i
could
for
we
both
were
sneezing
and
a
hideous
draught
like
the
breath
of
death
was
streaming
from
somewhere
i
don
t
mind
looking
at
pictures
of
abbeys
and
the
like
but
when
i
read
of
the
grandeur
of
living
in
that
sort
of
place
i
laugh
the
men
who
built
them
did
as
well
as
they
could
in
the
age
they
lived
in
but
what
shall
be
said
of
men
who
dwell
in
them
now
when
infinitely
better
is
to
be
had
those
upper
chambers
cold
clammy
draughty
the
furniture
and
hangings
old
and
dowdy
and
my
daughter
s
room
like
a
squalid
decrepit
tenement
flat
yes
squalid
for
the
rugs
and
draperies
were
dirty
were
stained
and
frayed
there
was
a
distinct
tenement
odor
isn
t
it
fascinating
said
she
gazing
round
with
sparkling
eyes
where
s
the
fire
said
i
she
led
me
to
a
smelly
low
ceilinged
little
room
like
a
segment
out
of
a
hovel
it
was
her
boudoir
she
informed
me
in
one
wall
in
a
dinky
fireplace
burned
a
handful
of
fire
is
that
it
said
i
is
that
all
you
must
remember
papa
said
she
proudly
that
this
isn
t
a
modern
house
ring
for
a
servant
said
i
this
overcoat
of
mine
is
too
light
i
must
have
wraps
if
i
m
to
sit
here
and
you
d
better
get
out
your
furs
and
put
them
on
the
servants
d
think
me
mad
said
she
must
you
have
a
coat
no
that
spread
will
do
said
i
and
i
jerked
it
from
the
sofa
and
flung
it
round
my
shoulders
i
don
t
want
to
upset
your
establishment
good
god
i
had
no
idea
people
with
any
money
at
all
anywhere
on
earth
lived
like
this
if
you
re
going
to
stay
here
you
must
put
in
steam
heat
oh
we
couldn
t
do
that
papa
dear
said
she
with
a
plaintive
mingling
of
shame
for
me
and
apology
for
the
tradition
against
sense
and
health
let
s
get
to
business
margot
said
i
sit
in
the
fireplace
that
s
right
what
s
the
trouble
your
mother
has
explained
has
told
all
she
knew
i
ve
come
to
find
what
the
quarrel
is
really
about
has
she
told
you
of
that
woman
why
did
he
go
back
to
her
she
began
to
sob
oh
the
hideous
things
he
said
to
me
i
didn
t
dream
a
gentleman
could
talk
like
that
he
called
me
a
low
american
said
he
was
ashamed
of
me
said
he
was
going
to
get
rid
of
me
at
any
cost
said
but
what
had
you
done
interrupted
i
nothing
she
cried
lifting
her
flushed
face
absolutely
nothing
except
worship
him
what
had
you
done
i
repeated
as
she
started
to
rise
i
restrained
her
stay
in
the
fireplace
what
was
the
beginning
of
the
row
the
very
beginning
her
eyes
wavered
but
she
said
nothing
papa
though
less
vigorously
it
was
about
money
said
i
it
always
is
in
all
ranks
of
society
the
beginnings
of
the
quarrels
have
money
at
the
bottom
of
them
now
tell
me
she
was
silent
i
can
t
help
you
unless
you
do
oh
it
was
so
sordid
cried
she
and
i
thought
him
high
above
those
things
no
one
that
s
human
is
said
i
any
person
who
wears
pants
or
skirts
that
have
to
be
paid
for
is
not
above
money
he
wanted
me
to
turn
over
to
him
all
i
had
said
she
think
of
that
i
might
have
known
said
i
he
said
it
was
beneath
his
dignity
as
an
english
gentleman
to
have
a
wife
independent
of
him
and
do
you
know
papa
i
was
so
infatuated
that
i
almost
yielded
i
could
see
his
point
of
view
and
i
d
have
been
glad
to
come
to
him
for
every
cent
only
she
stopped
short
only
what
i
urged
i
heard
about
that
other
woman
and
his
way
of
treating
me
he
said
it
was
the
proper
way
for
a
marquis
to
treat
his
marchioness
and
i
liked
the
dignity
and
the
beauty
of
it
all
when
others
were
about
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
when
we
were
alone
oh
papa
i
can
t
tell
you
these
things
never
mind
said
i
i
understand
and
i
was
a
little
jealous
away
down
in
my
heart
and
suspicious
and
i
was
afraid
he
wanted
the
money
to
spend
on
her
um
said
i
you
didn
t
tell
your
mother
this
she
hates
sordidness
of
every
kind
said
margot
and
i
hadn
t
the
courage
besides
i
m
sure
mamma
would
have
advised
me
to
let
him
have
his
way
she
wouldn
t
sympathize
with
the
the
weak
side
of
my
character
i
was
interested
could
it
be
that
edna
s
daughter
had
a
weak
a
human
side
could
it
be
that
her
education
and
her
mode
of
life
had
not
altogether
killed
the
natural
and
made
her
soul
a
garden
of
artificial
flowers
only
so
you
want
to
be
free
from
him
said
i
free
from
him
cried
she
aghast
give
up
my
position
oh
papa
never
never
but
you
don
t
love
him
don
t
come
away
from
that
fire
she
seated
herself
by
the
miserable
smoky
little
blaze
again
he
is
my
husband
i
am
his
wife
i
am
the
marchioness
of
crossley
and
she
drew
herself
up
with
as
much
of
an
air
as
her
cold
and
the
contracted
space
in
the
chimney
piece
permitted
unluckily
the
sudden
gesture
caused
a
current
of
air
and
she
sneezed
once
twice
three
times
better
get
those
furs
said
i
you
want
the
man
back
yes
indeed
i
must
have
him
back
she
clasped
her
hands
and
wailed
if
i
only
had
a
son
then
then
i
d
show
hugh
that
he
couldn
t
trample
on
me
but
he
has
me
in
his
power
now
if
he
casts
me
off
i
shan
t
have
any
position
at
all
the
women
are
down
on
me
they
hate
all
the
american
women
except
those
who
toady
to
them
and
give
them
money
or
jewelry
or
pay
their
bridge
and
dressmaker
s
bills
and
they
re
only
too
glad
of
the
chance
to
crush
me
but
they
ll
not
succeed
why
not
said
i
dryly
she
burst
into
tears
oh
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
papa
shall
i
give
him
the
money
sign
over
all
my
income
to
him
and
take
only
what
he
ll
allow
me
and
would
he
come
back
if
i
did
he
would
not
said
i
then
what
shall
i
do
oh
what
slaves
we
women
are
think
of
it
papa
he
wants
to
make
a
slave
of
me
said
he
didn
t
believe
in
women
gadding
about
and
showing
themselves
off
in
costly
dresses
and
causing
scandalous
talk
said
my
place
was
at
home
looking
after
the
house
and
that
sort
of
thing
she
laughed
wildly
like
a
low
common
servant
and
he
he
free
to
carry
on
with
that
woman
you
might
teach
him
to
stay
at
home
if
you
set
him
a
good
example
suggested
i
but
i
don
t
want
to
stay
at
home
cried
she
i
didn
t
marry
for
that
i
want
to
enjoy
all
the
privileges
of
my
rank
to
be
sure
said
i
i
wasn
t
brought
up
to
be
like
a
low
middle
class
woman
or
a
workingman
s
wife
no
indeed
said
i
you
are
a
lady
you
re
made
not
to
be
of
use
in
the
world
but
to
enjoy
yourself
she
seemed
to
find
some
cause
for
dissatisfaction
in
my
enthusiastic
tone
of
course
she
said
i
shall
do
my
duty
as
a
member
of
the
high
nobility
lead
in
society
and
open
bazars
and
visit
the
poor
on
our
estate
and
and
all
that
yes
indeed
said
i
and
the
world
being
what
it
is
there
s
no
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
do
you
think
you
can
bring
him
back
papa
that
depends
on
you
said
i
warily
i
ll
do
anything
anything
i
ll
crawl
to
him
if
he
wants
me
to
after
all
he
is
the
marquis
of
crossley
and
i
m
only
an
american
nobody
that
s
the
proper
spirit
said
i
but
you
mustn
t
show
it
to
him
too
plainly
be
moderate
a
little
pretense
of
dignity
of
self
respect
i
understand
said
she
seriously
she
was
indeed
edna
s
own
daughter
i
ll
be
as
i
was
before
we
were
married
her
eyes
flashed
oh
i
can
bide
my
time
when
i
have
a
son
get
ready
and
come
up
to
town
to
night
said
i
with
a
most
unfatherly
gruffness
and
curtness
i
fear
i
m
off
now
to
deal
with
him
be
careful
not
to
wound
his
pride
papa
she
cautioned
i
realize
the
danger
of
that
replied
i
come
to
the
savoy
be
on
hand
so
i
can
get
hold
of
you
whenever
i
need
you
oh
papa
dear
she
cried
and
cast
herself
into
my
arms
i
brushed
my
lips
upon
her
crown
of
hair
it
was
false
hair
that
being
the
fashion
of
the
day
try
to
make
yourself
as
pretty
as
you
can
said
i
releasing
her
and
myself
you
ll
hear
from
me
to
night
or
to
morrow
unless
i
ve
caught
my
death
in
this
damp
cave
you
must
leave
it
to
the
frogs
and
snakes
and
bats
and
build
yourself
a
decent
house
somewhere
you
ll
die
here
i
m
afraid
hugh
wouldn
t
consent
to
live
anywhere
but
here
it
s
the
ancestral
seat
you
know
the
massingfords
have
lived
here
since
forever
and
ever
have
died
here
you
mean
have
killed
wives
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
here
she
startled
looked
excitedly
at
me
papa
she
exclaimed
breathlessly
yes
i
wouldn
t
put
it
past
him
i
laughed
she
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
oh
you
weren
t
in
earnest
she
said
no
replied
i
but
don
t
live
here
i
shan
t
said
she
firmly
it
s
dreadful
for
the
looks
you
ve
seen
what
so
many
of
these
english
women
look
like
like
shriveled
frost
bitten
apples
said
i
they
don
t
die
because
they
re
used
to
it
but
it
s
death
for
people
accustomed
to
civilization
not
even
the
steady
glow
of
pride
in
your
title
and
position
can
keep
you
heated
up
enough
to
save
you
will
you
give
hugh
a
house
if
he
ll
consent
yes
until
to
night
or
to
morrow
and
i
fled
from
the
romantic
old
abbey
but
not
soon
enough
to
avoid
what
was
threatening
to
be
the
cold
of
my
life
ix
the
moment
i
was
in
london
and
before
that
sothewell
abbey
cold
had
a
chance
to
grip
me
i
went
at
it
starve
stay
in
bed
and
keep
the
air
out
for
a
day
that
s
the
way
to
put
a
cold
out
of
business
unless
it
be
some
occasional
prodigy
endowed
with
superhuman
common
sense
and
self
restraint
no
one
learns
how
to
take
care
of
his
health
except
by
experience
the
doctors
know
precious
little
about
disease
about
health
they
know
nothing
naturally
they
have
no
interest
in
health
the
average
human
being
not
only
does
not
know
how
to
take
care
of
his
health
but
also
does
not
wish
to
learn
how
health
involves
self
denial
cutting
down
on
food
drink
tobacco
and
the
other
joys
of
life
so
he
who
wishes
to
avoid
enormous
payments
in
discomfort
and
pain
for
slight
neglects
and
transgressions
of
physical
laws
has
to
work
it
out
for
himself
i
ve
made
several
valuable
discoveries
in
the
science
and
art
of
living
about
the
most
valuable
of
them
is
that
every
illness
starts
under
cover
of
a
cold
so
i
instantly
take
myself
in
hand
whenever
i
begin
to
sneeze
and
to
have
chilly
sensations
or
a
catch
in
the
throat
the
result
has
been
that
since
i
was
thirty
i
have
not
spent
a
cent
on
doctors
or
lost
a
day
through
illness
and
i
ve
eaten
and
drunk
about
as
i
pleased
i
can
see
gentle
reader
s
expression
of
disdain
at
these
confessions
as
to
my
care
for
health
you
are
welcome
to
your
disdain
gentle
reader
it
is
characteristic
of
your
shallowness
you
see
the
chief
difference
between
you
and
me
is
that
i
have
imagination
while
you
have
not
and
as
i
have
imagination
illness
makes
to
my
mind
a
picture
of
revolting
internal
conditions
which
i
can
no
more
endure
than
i
could
endure
having
my
outside
unclean
and
frowzy
margot
coming
by
a
later
train
sent
me
word
that
she
was
ill
she
had
called
in
a
doctor
he
poured
some
medicine
some
poison
into
her
of
course
and
so
got
her
into
the
way
of
giving
him
an
excuse
for
robbing
her
in
england
doctors
rank
socially
with
butchers
and
bakers
rank
scientifically
with
voodoo
quacks
and
astrologers
they
still
look
on
a
cold
as
a
trifle
and
treat
it
by
feeding
the
food
and
drugs
she
swallowed
soon
reduced
margot
to
the
state
where
it
was
taking
all
the
reserve
force
of
her
youth
to
save
her
from
severe
illness
i
was
entirely
well
the
following
day
and
went
to
see
her
the
doctor
five
guineas
or
twenty
five
dollars
a
visit
was
coming
twice
a
day
his
assistant
two
guineas
or
ten
dollars
a
visit
was
coming
four
times
a
day
the
marchioness
of
crossley
a
rich
american
was
ill
her
social
position
and
dr
sir
spratt
wallet
s
rank
as
a
practitioner
together
made
it
imperative
that
the
illness
be
no
ordinary
affair
the
second
day
he
issued
bulletins
to
the
papers
i
attempted
to
interfere
in
the
treatment
but
margot
would
not
have
it
she
s
growing
worse
instead
of
better
said
i
to
wallet
certainly
sir
replied
he
that
is
the
regular
course
with
a
cold
and
he
stroked
his
whiskers
and
looked
at
me
with
dull
self
complacent
supercilious
eyes
the
regular
course
sir
in
england
but
not
in
america
said
i
i
dare
say
said
he
with
heavy
politeness
then
after
a
heavy
pause
her
ladyship
will
be
quite
fit
again
in
a
week
quite
fit
as
she
was
eating
three
strapping
meals
a
day
and
taking
rhinitis
and
another
equally
poisonous
drug
i
had
my
doubts
but
once
you
let
a
doctor
in
you
are
powerless
if
you
order
him
out
without
giving
him
an
opportunity
in
his
own
good
time
to
cure
the
mischief
he
has
done
the
consequences
may
be
serious
not
to
linger
over
this
incident
in
high
life
wallet
made
out
of
that
cold
a
hundred
guineas
not
counting
his
commissions
on
the
fees
of
his
assistant
on
the
wages
of
a
trained
nurse
and
on
the
stuff
from
the
chemist
if
margot
had
been
english
born
the
bill
would
have
been
about
one
fourth
that
sum
for
the
same
rank
in
society
slay
the
midianite
but
that
s
the
rule
the
world
over
when
i
am
trimmed
abroad
i
console
myself
with
reflecting
on
the
fate
of
the
luckless
foreigner
visiting
america
europe
trims
us
to
the
quick
but
we
trim
to
the
bone
and
when
no
foreigners
are
handy
we
keep
in
practice
by
trimming
one
another
margot
s
illness
did
not
interfere
with
my
efforts
to
right
her
matrimonial
ship
and
set
it
in
its
course
again
i
had
greatly
modified
my
original
plan
it
involved
my
seeking
the
marquis
my
new
plan
was
to
compel
him
to
seek
me
i
proceeded
so
successfully
that
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
of
margot
s
indisposition
while
i
was
at
breakfast
in
my
sitting
room
markham
came
in
with
a
grin
of
triumph
on
his
face
you
win
he
cried
but
you
always
do
dawkins
here
s
his
card
let
him
up
no
wait
tell
him
i
ll
see
him
in
half
an
hour
gentle
reader
you
are
about
to
learn
why
in
that
controversy
over
settlements
i
abruptly
abandoned
the
struggle
and
yielded
everything
i
worked
with
markham
at
my
mail
and
telegrams
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
before
i
let
dawkins
in
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
my
treatment
of
him
had
produced
the
effect
i
had
hoped
he
was
a
typical
middle
class
englishman
but
all
middle
class
englishmen
are
typical
he
was
fattish
and
baldish
and
smug
he
had
a
beef
and
beer
face
ruddy
and
smooth
except
tufts
of
red
gray
curling
whiskers
before
either
ear
he
had
cold
shrewd
pious
eyes
the
eyes
of
the
hypocrite
who
serves
the
lord
with
every
breath
he
draws
and
gets
a
blessing
upon
every
crime
he
commits
before
committing
it
in
my
first
interviews
with
him
i
being
new
to
england
had
made
the
mistake
of
treating
him
as
an
equal
that
is
as
a
human
being
my
respect
for
myself
forbids
me
to
meet
any
of
my
fellow
members
of
the
human
race
in
any
other
fashion
but
experience
has
taught
me
that
in
doing
business
with
a
man
it
is
being
absolutely
necessary
that
you
dominate
him
unless
you
are
willing
to
have
him
dominate
you
the
most
skillful
care
must
be
taken
to
impress
him
with
your
superiority
a
certain
amount
of
side
is
useful
in
america
a
lot
of
it
is
imperative
in
england
and
if
you
are
dealing
with
an
englishman
who
feels
that
he
is
low
you
dare
not
treat
him
as
an
equal
or
he
at
once
imagines
you
are
lower
than
he
and
despicable
and
you
can
do
nothing
with
him
i
had
suffered
and
so
had
my
lawyer
norman
for
our
american
way
of
treating
dawkins
i
appreciated
my
mistake
afterwards
and
resolved
not
to
repeat
it
i
studied
the
manner
of
crossley
and
blankenship
and
the
other
upper
class
men
toward
the
middle
and
lower
classes
and
i
learned
to
copy
it
an
accomplishment
of
which
i
am
not
proud
though
common
sense
forbids
me
to
be
ashamed
of
it
dawkins
entering
with
heels
thoroughly
cooled
made
ready
to
put
out
his
hand
but
did
so
hesitatingly
he
saw
that
his
worst
fears
were
realized
altered
the
handshaking
gesture
into
a
tug
at
his
right
whiskers
nor
did
i
offer
him
a
seat
but
simply
looked
at
him
pleasantly
over
the
top
of
my
newspaper
and
said
ah
dawkins
is
that
you
good
morning
mr
loring
hope
you
are
well
sir
said
dawkins
now
squeezing
awkwardly
into
his
proper
place
i
half
turned
my
back
on
him
and
dictated
a
note
and
a
telegram
to
markham
then
i
glanced
at
dawkins
again
ah
dawkins
yes
what
were
you
saying
i
would
esteem
it
a
favor
sir
if
you
would
give
me
a
few
minutes
of
your
time
alone
we
are
alone
said
i
what
is
it
the
solicitor
shifted
his
portly
frame
uneasily
smoothed
his
top
hat
with
his
gloved
left
hand
glanced
dubiously
at
markham
the
matter
is
confidential
sir
relating
to
to
the
family
mr
markham
knows
more
about
my
affairs
than
i
do
said
i
don
t
beat
about
the
bush
dawkins
i
have
no
time
to
waste
very
well
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
it
concerns
those
bonds
the
bonds
you
turned
over
to
me
in
arranging
the
settlements
yes
i
remember
great
lakes
and
gulf
bonds
were
they
not
precisely
sir
you
bound
us
to
a
stipulation
that
they
were
not
to
be
converted
for
at
least
five
years
that
s
right
said
i
in
fact
i
made
it
impossible
for
you
to
convert
them
a
pained
expression
came
into
the
face
of
dawkins
i
believe
i
conceded
everything
else
your
client
demanded
pursued
i
but
it
now
develops
sir
said
dawkins
that
that
was
the
only
important
thing
really
said
i
you
have
doubtless
seen
the
papers
these
last
few
days
the
stock
market
yes
yes
so
the
bonds
are
dropping
that
s
unfortunate
dropping
rapidly
said
dawkins
and
there
are
rumors
that
great
lakes
and
gulf
will
soon
be
practically
worthless
so
i
ve
read
i
ve
come
to
ask
you
to
release
us
we
wish
to
sell
we
must
sell
if
we
don
t
the
settlement
on
your
son
in
law
will
be
worthless
i
smiled
agreeably
as
worthless
as
his
promises
to
my
daughter
as
worthless
as
he
is
dawkins
was
breathing
heavily
his
pious
eyes
were
snapping
with
rage
he
had
prided
himself
on
his
astuteness
he
had
gloated
over
his
shrewdness
in
outwitting
norman
and
me
and
now
he
discovered
that
the
boot
was
on
the
other
leg
i
had
trapped
him
and
put
him
and
his
client
in
my
power
i
leaned
back
comfortably
and
smiled
of
course
i
know
nothing
about
it
dawkins
but
i
am
willing
to
make
a
yankee
guess
that
the
bonds
will
continue
to
drop
until
when
my
pause
became
unendurable
he
said
yes
sir
until
when
until
i
discover
some
signs
of
value
in
my
son
in
law
then
he
may
discover
some
signs
of
value
in
the
bonds
our
america
is
a
peculiar
country
dawkins
peculiar
will
do
sir
said
he
with
respectful
insolence
but
i
should
have
chosen
another
word
i
shook
my
head
laughingly
what
bad
losers
you
english
are
said
i
but
i
ll
not
detain
you
good
morning
dawkins
then
i
am
to
understand
sir
but
i
had
my
back
squarely
to
him
and
was
busy
with
markham
who
took
his
cue
for
the
little
comedy
we
were
playing
like
the
well
trained
american
business
man
that
he
was
presently
markham
said
he
s
gone
and
i
never
saw
a
madder
man
get
out
of
a
room
more
awkwardly
you
gentle
reader
who
know
about
as
much
of
the
science
of
managing
men
in
practical
life
as
you
know
of
any
other
phase
of
the
world
that
is
you
gentle
reader
are
shocked
by
my
rudeness
to
a
polite
well
educated
well
dressed
englishman
and
you
hope
and
feel
that
i
overreached
myself
but
let
me
inform
you
not
for
your
instruction
but
for
my
own
satisfaction
courtesy
has
to
be
used
most
sparingly
human
vanity
is
so
monstrous
that
men
eagerly
read
into
politeness
to
them
the
most
ordinary
politeness
evidence
that
their
superiority
is
inspiring
fear
awe
and
desire
to
conciliate
them
you
often
hear
men
in
high
place
severely
criticised
for
being
rude
short
arrogant
insulting
do
not
condemn
them
too
hastily
it
may
be
that
they
were
driven
into
this
attitude
toward
their
fellows
by
the
disastrous
consequences
of
courtesy
be
polite
to
a
man
and
he
will
misunderstand
be
cool
to
him
and
he
thickly
enveloped
in
his
own
good
opinion
of
himself
will
not
feel
it
rudeness
overt
and
unmistakable
is
often
the
one
way
to
reach
him
and
save
not
only
yourself
but
also
him
from
the
consequences
of
his
vanity
it
is
the
instinct
of
big
men
to
be
big
and
simple
and
natural
in
their
dealings
with
their
fellows
the
mass
of
little
men
with
big
vanities
compels
them
to
suppress
this
instinct
and
by
suppression
it
inevitably
becomes
in
time
crushed
out
of
existence
how
can
one
who
is
busy
continue
to
show
consideration
for
others
if
they
instead
of
showing
a
return
consideration
for
him
take
it
as
tribute
to
their
importance
and
begin
to
rear
and
impose
and
trample
to
cite
my
own
relatively
unimportant
case
i
have
long
had
a
reputation
for
coldness
and
meager
civility
in
my
business
relations
i
recall
distinctly
the
desperate
pressure
of
sheer
imposition
that
led
me
to
abandon
my
early
openness
to
all
comers
at
all
times
and
i
admit
that
i
did
change
rather
abruptly
too
for
it
suddenly
came
to
me
why
i
was
slipping
backwards
but
looking
only
at
my
career
since
the
change
when
i
think
of
the
boredom
i
have
endured
the
folly
i
have
permitted
to
waste
my
valuable
time
when
i
recall
the
forbearance
i
have
shown
in
sparing
impudent
and
lazy
incompetence
where
i
might
yes
ought
to
have
used
the
ax
when
i
think
of
my
good
natured
tolerance
in
face
of
extremest
daily
provocation
year
after
year
i
marvel
at
myself
and
feel
how
unjust
how
characteristically
the
verdict
of
little
shallow
men
is
the
attack
on
me
as
cold
and
unsympathetic
when
i
consider
how
the
leaders
of
the
human
race
have
been
tempted
to
tyranny
i
cannot
understand
why
history
is
able
to
record
comparatively
few
real
tyrants
most
of
them
being
homicidal
lunatics
like
nero
or
success
crazed
megalomaniacs
like
napoleon
and
almost
none
men
of
sanity
if
the
great
of
earth
were
as
vain
as
selfishly
as
egotistically
inconsiderate
of
the
small
as
the
small
are
of
the
great
and
of
each
other
would
not
the
story
of
history
have
come
to
an
end
long
ago
for
lack
of
surviving
characters
two
days
after
dawkins
came
crossley
i
knew
that
in
america
there
is
no
one
so
easily
frightened
as
a
rich
man
who
has
inherited
his
wealth
and
does
not
know
whether
if
he
lost
it
he
could
make
a
living
or
not
all
rich
men
are
cowards
but
that
species
is
craven
i
suspected
that
the
same
thing
was
true
of
the
european
type
the
nobleman
with
the
grotesque
pose
of
disdain
for
money
that
convinces
and
captivates
you
gentle
reader
and
your
favorite
authors
crossley
s
face
instantly
showed
me
that
my
suspicion
was
correct
he
had
been
dissipating
wildly
for
several
weeks
but
it
did
not
account
for
the
look
in
his
eyes
if
gentle
reader
you
wish
to
learn
the
truth
about
the
aristocracy
you
worship
which
you
do
not
get
an
aristocrat
where
you
can
cut
off
or
turn
on
his
supply
of
cash
at
will
you
will
then
discover
that
he
who
has
a
stiff
neck
also
has
supple
knees
the
stiffer
the
neck
the
suppler
the
knees
crossley
was
a
clever
chap
in
his
way
that
is
he
knew
his
business
of
idle
spender
of
unearned
money
thoroughly
another
mode
of
putting
it
would
be
the
commonplace
and
less
exact
if
more
alluring
phrase
aristocrat
to
his
finger
tips
there
are
many
modes
of
cringing
he
showed
judgment
and
taste
judgment
of
me
taste
in
sparing
himself
in
his
choice
of
the
mode
with
fright
and
wariness
in
his
eyes
the
look
of
readiness
to
go
to
any
depths
of
self
abasement
in
gaining
his
end
he
put
a
tone
of
manly
bluff
shamefaced
contrition
into
his
voice
as
he
said
pardon
my
breaking
in
on
you
this
way
i
ve
just
heard
is
she
very
ill
he
meant
he
had
just
heard
about
the
bonds
i
knew
he
meant
that
and
he
knew
i
knew
it
but
we
were
men
of
the
world
not
desperately
ill
said
i
only
about
twenty
guineas
a
day
he
smiled
a
faint
but
flattering
appreciation
of
my
humor
then
resumed
his
gloomy
anxiety
and
self
reproach
but
she
is
ill
i
read
it
in
one
of
those
screaming
ha
penny
rags
and
came
as
fast
as
ever
i
could
the
truth
is
well
we
ve
had
a
bit
of
a
row
has
she
told
you
not
much
said
i
a
little
i
ve
acted
the
skunk
the
howling
skunk
and
i
want
to
do
you
think
she
ll
see
me
if
you
wish
i
ll
find
out
i
d
be
no
end
grateful
said
he
with
enthusiasm
she
saw
him
as
soon
as
she
could
make
herself
presentable
and
her
delay
gave
him
a
chance
to
tone
up
his
nerves
and
to
smooth
out
his
face
that
afternoon
i
was
able
to
telegraph
edna
that
all
was
well
the
crossleys
were
reconciled
love
had
scored
another
of
his
famous
triumphs
she
came
over
the
following
day
but
i
had
sailed
for
america
a
few
hours
before
the
day
after
my
arrival
in
new
york
i
saw
mary
kirkwood
and
hartley
beechman
lunching
together
at
delmonico
s
in
those
days
that
meant
an
engagement
actual
or
impending
or
at
least
a
flirtation
far
advanced
into
the
stage
of
loverlike
intimacy
i
was
in
the
passageway
looking
through
the
glass
and
the
screen
of
palms
i
stood
there
long
noting
every
detail
of
her
she
was
well
perfectly
well
of
that
much
her
eyes
and
her
color
assured
me
is
there
anything
lovelier
than
a
clear
dark
skin
tastefully
set
off
by
black
brown
hair
was
she
happy
i
could
not
tell
still
in
her
face
was
that
restless
expectant
look
not
unlike
the
expression
of
a
child
being
shown
a
picture
book
and
too
impatient
for
the
next
page
rightly
to
examine
the
one
that
is
open
an
intense
interest
in
life
an
intense
vitality
that
fascinating
capacity
to
love
if
she
found
the
right
man
and
her
beauty
beauty
she
undoubtedly
had
but
charm
does
not
lie
in
beauty
physical
charm
i
mean
there
is
a
certain
light
in
the
eyes
a
certain
curve
of
cheek
and
throat
of
bosom
and
arm
and
the
blood
flames
and
rushes
she
had
charm
for
me
her
beauty
impressed
others
it
was
her
charm
that
made
her
the
one
woman
to
me
blankenship
came
to
take
me
into
the
caf
where
we
were
to
lunch
i
went
with
the
meager
consolation
that
while
i
had
stood
there
she
had
given
beechman
not
a
single
glance
with
any
suggestion
of
a
feeling
it
would
have
wounded
me
to
the
quick
to
see
should
i
speak
to
her
did
i
dare
risk
the
attempt
would
not
speaking
to
her
be
merely
a
useless
torment
after
a
long
struggle
that
could
have
but
one
end
i
said
excuse
me
rose
and
went
to
the
palm
room
they
were
gone
the
waiter
was
clearing
the
table
at
which
they
had
been
sitting
i
stared
round
dazedly
returned
to
blankenship
you
re
not
up
to
the
mark
what
said
he
new
york
doesn
t
agree
with
me
i
hate
towns
they
give
you
such
dirty
second
hand
stuff
to
breathe
let
s
move
on
what
to
morrow
i
said
but
it
seemed
there
was
no
place
on
earth
for
me
don
t
judge
me
so
poorly
as
to
think
or
to
imagine
i
thought
this
was
due
wholly
to
mary
kirkwood
i
wish
to
be
carefully
exactly
accurate
in
this
frank
recital
of
a
man
s
point
of
view
she
was
responsible
for
my
forlorn
state
to
the
extent
that
loving
her
had
revealed
to
me
the
futility
and
failure
of
my
own
life
and
had
made
me
see
another
sort
of
life
that
would
have
been
possible
with
her
that
was
impossible
without
her
without
love
and
comradeship
but
loving
her
did
not
make
my
life
empty
it
was
already
empty
though
i
had
not
realized
it
i
understood
now
why
the
big
business
men
as
soon
as
they
reached
security
cast
about
for
some
real
interest
most
of
them
nearly
all
were
as
unfortunate
in
their
family
relations
as
i
they
had
trivial
wives
and
trivial
children
mere
silly
strutters
and
spenders
they
sought
interest
in
art
in
science
in
religion
in
exploration
in
philanthropy
in
politics
in
stamps
and
butterflies
in
old
books
and
antiques
in
racing
stables
and
prize
fighting
in
gambling
in
drink
in
women
their
craving
was
now
mine
how
to
find
an
interest
that
would
make
life
attractive
to
me
with
mary
kirkwood
left
out
there
was
my
problem
while
waiting
for
the
solution
i
followed
blankenship
to
the
northwest
the
second
day
from
new
york
as
he
and
i
were
walking
up
and
down
the
platform
during
a
halt
at
st
paul
i
think
it
was
hartley
beechman
joined
us
didn
t
i
see
you
in
the
caf
at
delmonico
s
a
few
days
ago
said
he
i
was
getting
my
hat
and
stick
in
a
rush
it
certainly
looked
like
your
back
it
was
said
i
and
i
was
seized
with
a
wild
longing
to
escape
from
him
and
a
wilder
longing
to
hold
on
to
him
and
to
pour
out
question
after
question
mrs
kirkwood
and
i
were
lunching
together
he
went
on
we
talked
of
you
i
told
her
i
thought
i
had
seen
you
and
she
said
she
heard
you
were
in
town
and
was
much
hurt
because
you
hadn
t
looked
her
up
i
was
merely
passing
through
said
i
she
has
an
enormous
admiration
for
you
continued
he
she
says
you
have
imagination
which
means
that
she
thinks
you
in
the
small
class
you
know
the
world
divides
into
sheep
and
goats
on
imagination
with
the
mass
in
the
have
not
class
i
believe
it
s
the
true
distinction
between
house
of
have
and
house
of
have
not
she
is
well
said
i
always
she
knows
how
to
take
care
of
herself
i
never
knew
a
woman
so
sensible
and
sensible
means
the
reverse
of
what
it
s
usually
supposed
to
mean
when
applied
to
a
woman
this
hardly
sounded
like
an
engaged
man
talking
of
his
fianc
e
on
the
other
hand
beechman
was
a
peculiar
chap
does
she
still
live
in
the
country
just
now
yes
last
winter
she
kept
house
for
bob
in
new
york
but
you
will
not
be
interested
in
how
i
drew
from
him
bit
by
bit
a
hundred
details
of
her
life
stories
of
what
she
had
said
and
done
i
saw
beechman
several
hours
every
day
until
he
left
us
at
seattle
alternately
i
thought
him
merely
her
closest
man
friend
and
her
accepted
lover
at
times
i
thought
he
was
not
quite
sure
himself
in
which
position
he
stood
when
we
were
having
our
last
talk
together
i
nerved
myself
and
said
i
heard
in
london
that
she
was
to
be
married
i
felt
him
drawing
in
and
shutting
all
doors
and
windows
have
you
heard
anything
of
it
pursued
i
oh
in
the
case
of
a
woman
like
her
replied
he
there
s
always
gossip
about
this
man
and
that
she
ought
to
marry
she
will
marry
i
forced
a
smile
and
as
we
knew
each
other
so
well
i
ventured
you
speak
as
one
having
authority
don
t
you
know
she
will
parried
he
that
sounds
like
evasion
laughed
i
not
at
all
she
cannot
escape
some
man
will
convince
her
surely
but
so
far
as
you
know
no
man
has
his
eyes
were
frankly
mocking
i
did
not
say
that
said
he
and
i
could
get
no
further
before
i
returned
to
new
york
in
the
autumn
i
had
added
a
lot
of
far
western
enterprises
to
my
already
long
list
of
occupations
everything
i
touched
seemed
to
succeed
even
my
new
secretary
rossiter
proved
better
than
markham
markham
had
an
indifferent
memory
and
a
fondness
for
women
that
was
trying
rossiter
forgot
nothing
and
was
as
shy
of
the
women
including
the
ladies
as
was
lord
blankenship
who
yawned
and
retreated
at
the
very
sight
of
a
skirt
the
news
from
england
was
altogether
satisfactory
an
heir
was
hoped
for
and
crossley
had
become
a
devoted
husband
and
was
about
to
enter
politics
this
struck
me
as
a
huge
joke
the
more
so
because
i
knew
that
in
england
crossley
would
be
welcomed
as
a
source
of
real
strength
to
his
party
it
seemed
to
me
amazing
how
england
could
stagger
along
when
she
was
being
managed
by
such
men
and
was
grateful
for
it
but
when
i
spoke
to
blankenship
about
it
he
set
me
to
thinking
from
a
different
standpoint
my
son
in
law
is
going
into
politics
said
i
in
america
he
couldn
t
be
elected
dog
catcher
oh
i
fancy
money
will
do
most
anything
most
anywhere
said
he
the
news
from
paris
was
equally
good
edna
had
settled
there
after
a
joyous
summer
going
from
country
house
to
country
house
in
britain
and
from
ch
teau
to
ch
teau
in
france
she
had
seen
one
ch
teau
which
she
wished
me
to
buy
and
she
begged
me
to
come
over
and
inspect
it
she
did
not
explicitly
say
so
but
i
read
between
the
lines
that
she
was
greatly
strengthening
her
social
position
by
giving
out
that
she
purposed
buying
a
big
place
you
may
imagine
how
much
enthusiasm
for
her
such
an
announcement
would
create
among
noble
down
at
the
heel
families
eager
to
exchange
unsalable
old
rook
roosts
for
american
dollars
i
could
hear
her
talking
how
subtly
she
would
put
forth
the
suggestion
how
diplomatically
she
would
discuss
each
worthless
stone
heap
in
turn
and
how
she
would
rake
in
the
invitations
so
difficult
to
get
unless
one
happens
to
know
how
and
so
easy
when
one
does
know
but
with
my
arrival
in
new
york
i
had
a
reverse
a
cable
came
from
edna
saying
that
she
was
sailing
at
once
and
wished
to
see
me
i
could
not
imagine
what
she
wanted
and
i
did
not
waste
much
time
in
making
guesses
one
evening
when
armitage
and
i
were
dining
together
in
the
federal
club
blankenship
had
sailed
for
home
the
idea
flashed
into
my
mind
that
perhaps
edna
wanted
a
divorce
immediately
i
felt
that
i
had
hit
upon
the
precise
reason
for
her
coming
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
imagining
what
was
the
next
idea
in
my
train
of
thought
if
she
divorced
me
i
should
be
free
to
marry
whom
i
pleased
it
was
stupid
of
me
but
in
all
my
revolvings
of
my
hopeless
love
for
mary
kirkwood
never
once
had
i
thought
of
divorcing
my
wife
i
cannot
account
for
this
lapse
except
as
an
instance
of
the
universal
human
failing
for
overlooking
the
obvious
there
was
no
religious
scruple
in
my
early
training
to
make
me
shy
of
divorce
on
the
contrary
my
parents
like
most
old
fashioned
americans
of
faiths
other
than
episcopal
and
catholic
and
episcopalians
and
catholics
were
few
in
the
old
american
stock
except
in
new
york
and
baltimore
and
south
carolina
most
old
fashioned
americans
believed
that
living
together
in
wedlock
without
love
was
sin
that
divorce
was
no
mere
necessary
evil
but
a
religious
rite
as
sacred
as
marriage
itself
a
house
they
held
is
either
a
house
of
hate
or
a
house
of
love
and
no
one
should
remain
in
a
house
of
hate
and
no
child
should
be
brought
up
there
no
doubt
if
edna
and
i
had
been
living
under
the
same
roof
the
idea
of
divorce
would
have
taken
form
actively
definite
form
long
before
but
we
had
no
home
to
be
a
house
of
hate
we
did
not
hate
each
other
we
bored
each
other
and
as
we
were
not
poor
we
lived
far
enough
apart
not
to
annoy
each
other
in
the
least
i
cheerfully
paid
any
ransom
she
exacted
for
leaving
me
free
and
you
may
be
sure
she
was
not
inexpensive
she
had
her
own
fortune
and
it
gave
her
quite
an
income
but
she
husbanded
that
she
insisted
upon
state
and
equipage
not
to
mention
such
small
matters
as
stockings
at
fifty
dollars
a
pair
and
chemises
at
three
hundred
dollars
apiece
for
she
knew
how
lovely
she
was
and
demanded
for
her
beautiful
body
the
most
beautiful
garments
that
could
be
devised
by
french
ingenuity
at
combining
cost
and
simplicity
i
was
by
instinct
rather
than
by
avowed
principles
thoroughly
old
fashioned
in
my
family
ideas
indeed
i
still
am
and
i
say
this
with
no
apology
it
may
be
that
woman
will
some
day
develop
another
and
higher
sphere
for
herself
but
first
she
would
do
well
in
my
humbly
heretical
opinion
to
learn
to
fill
the
sphere
she
now
rattles
round
in
like
one
dry
pea
in
a
ten
gallon
can
i
want
to
see
a
few
more
women
up
to
the
modern
requirements
for
wife
and
mother
i
want
to
see
a
few
more
women
making
a
living
without
using
their
sex
charms
a
few
less
tending
the
typewriter
with
one
eye
while
the
other
and
busier
is
on
the
lookout
for
a
husband
i
believe
in
emancipation
of
women
in
votes
for
women
in
all
that
sort
of
thing
the
one
and
only
way
to
learn
to
swim
is
in
the
water
i
am
sick
and
tired
of
woman
the
irresponsible
woman
the
cozener
and
milker
of
man
woman
the
dead
weight
upon
man
and
drawing
the
pay
of
a
housewife
and
shirking
all
a
housewife
s
duties
so
you
see
i
am
the
friend
of
woman
not
of
woman
s
vanity
and
laziness
and
passion
for
parasiteism
but
of
woman
s
education
and
self
respect
and
independence
i
was
thoroughly
old
fashioned
my
notion
of
wife
was
the
independent
self
respecting
equal
of
her
husband
that
is
i
had
the
typical
american
husband
s
ideal
the
ideal
that
dates
from
the
pioneer
days
of
no
property
and
of
labor
for
all
the
ideal
the
american
man
still
lives
up
to
the
one
that
enables
woman
to
betray
him
and
having
this
ideal
i
never
permitted
myself
no
not
even
when
i
spoke
to
her
the
contrary
in
words
i
never
permitted
myself
to
feel
that
my
wife
was
not
in
the
main
what
she
should
be
if
you
have
borne
me
company
thus
far
gentle
reader
turn
away
now
for
dreadful
things
are
coming
i
said
to
armitage
your
sister
she
s
still
in
the
country
no
she
s
abroad
replied
he
she
s
visiting
friends
in
budapest
later
on
she
s
to
yacht
in
the
east
mediterranean
she
and
the
horace
armstrongs
and
beechman
and
he
gave
several
names
i
do
not
now
recall
is
she
engaged
to
beechman
i
asked
carelessly
but
the
question
was
not
one
that
could
sound
other
than
raw
he
smiled
an
expression
i
did
not
like
at
first
i
thought
it
a
rebuke
to
my
impertinence
afterwards
i
saw
no
such
notion
was
in
his
mind
beechman
good
lord
no
you
are
sure
absolute
he
d
not
dare
go
in
that
direction
with
her
why
not
said
i
oh
well
you
see
she
doesn
t
care
for
him
replied
armitage
lamely
i
was
not
liking
him
so
well
now
that
i
knew
the
world
his
world
better
and
could
judge
its
beliefs
and
its
hypocrisies
more
accurately
he
s
an
unusual
man
said
i
she
might
easily
care
for
him
well
she
doesn
t
retorted
he
irritably
i
happen
to
know
she
doesn
t
i
was
convinced
armitage
s
tone
said
in
effect
that
he
had
heard
the
rumor
had
questioned
her
had
been
assured
that
there
was
no
basis
for
it
so
she
was
abroad
five
or
six
days
away
i
could
not
go
to
her
and
make
a
beginning
would
i
have
gone
if
she
had
been
within
reach
i
do
not
know
i
rather
think
not
as
i
have
said
i
was
old
fashioned
and
the
sort
of
love
i
felt
for
her
and
my
sense
of
what
she
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
first
man
she
had
trusted
would
have
made
me
wait
i
hope
until
i
was
free
still
love
is
insidiously
compelling
who
can
say
what
love
would
or
would
not
beguile
or
goad
him
into
doing
the
old
fashioned
man
always
reminding
himself
that
women
haven
t
an
equal
chance
with
men
was
inclined
to
be
considerate
in
his
dealings
with
a
woman
the
new
fashioned
man
lets
her
look
out
for
herself
i
am
not
sure
that
he
is
wrong
perhaps
some
who
have
read
thus
far
will
guess
the
reason
for
my
doubt
you
may
imagine
how
impatiently
i
waited
for
edna
to
arrive
i
am
afraid
rossiter
found
me
difficult
in
those
intervening
days
only
the
weak
sort
of
men
and
women
are
easy
for
an
intelligent
person
to
live
with
men
and
women
of
positive
character
have
their
impossible
moods
i
made
this
remark
to
mary
kirkwood
on
that
yachting
trip
in
the
sound
and
her
quick
answer
was
yes
that
s
true
but
everything
worth
while
is
difficult
weathering
the
stormy
days
would
have
its
compensations
and
more
what
a
woman
no
wonder
i
loved
her
when
edna
finally
arrived
what
an
arrival
it
was
she
was
attended
by
two
maids
one
french
the
other
italian
she
had
trained
them
she
and
their
former
fashionable
mistresses
to
treat
her
as
if
she
was
a
royal
person
requiring
the
most
minute
assistance
incapable
even
of
ascertaining
for
herself
whether
it
was
daylight
or
dark
rain
or
shine
she
was
clad
in
the
latest
paris
fashions
adapted
and
improved
for
her
own
especial
charms
she
wore
much
jewelry
but
nothing
noisy
there
never
was
anything
noisy
about
her
any
more
than
there
is
about
a
burst
of
sunshine
that
fills
and
floods
the
whole
place
permeating
everywhere
and
dominating
everything
she
talked
by
turns
in
english
with
a
superb
british
accent
in
french
that
sounded
parisian
and
in
italian
that
seemed
as
liquid
and
swift
as
the
italian
maid
s
it
was
a
vast
ship
and
there
were
about
a
thousand
passengers
and
much
luggage
to
me
to
all
on
the
pier
that
day
there
seemed
to
be
but
one
landing
and
but
one
lot
of
luggage
how
many
trunks
had
she
heaven
only
knows
the
customs
people
were
glad
to
expedite
her
after
a
glance
at
the
exhibit
imposing
both
in
extent
and
in
costliness
she
affected
a
delightful
most
aristocratic
unconsciousness
of
the
stir
she
was
making
of
the
excited
admiration
of
men
of
the
gaping
or
jeering
envy
of
women
yes
it
was
a
great
day
and
as
i
accompanied
her
in
the
auto
to
the
plaza
i
felt
dowdy
and
insignificant
felt
like
a
humble
male
menial
a
courier
or
valet
i
did
not
fully
appreciate
your
magnificence
said
i
until
i
saw
you
on
these
humble
shores
it
is
shocking
here
isn
t
it
said
she
so
incomplete
so
crude
no
wonder
the
ideals
are
low
the
surroundings
give
no
inspiration
none
except
for
work
said
i
it
s
a
land
for
working
people
only
no
doubt
you
ll
be
going
back
soon
as
soon
as
i
can
replied
she
with
a
friendly
but
not
tender
smile
as
soon
as
you
ll
let
me
the
absence
of
her
customary
effusiveness
confirmed
my
theory
of
her
coming
i
had
thought
all
out
with
the
utmost
care
i
felt
it
would
be
in
every
way
unwise
to
let
her
see
that
i
was
eager
for
the
divorce
she
must
open
the
subject
it
had
ever
been
my
rule
when
i
wanted
anything
so
to
maneuver
that
the
other
person
should
propose
the
exchange
it
is
the
rule
of
successful
operation
in
every
department
of
life
therefore
adhering
strictly
to
my
prearranged
programme
i
could
only
sit
tight
and
wait
how
she
tried
my
patience
i
was
mad
to
have
the
preliminaries
over
to
have
the
divorce
under
way
mad
not
with
the
hysterical
impatience
of
those
short
sighted
people
who
mess
their
purposes
through
lack
of
self
restraint
but
with
the
white
hot
repressed
patience
of
those
who
have
their
way
in
this
world
day
followed
day
and
she
did
not
speak
i
gave
up
the
evenings
and
a
large
part
of
the
afternoons
to
her
i
stayed
on
after
dinner
until
there
was
no
further
excuse
for
lingering
i
listened
to
her
interminable
recital
of
fashionable
names
dates
gossip
adventure
a
week
of
this
and
just
as
my
fortitude
was
wearing
itself
out
and
i
had
begun
to
debate
opening
the
subject
myself
she
said
i
ve
been
down
looking
at
our
house
really
it
s
not
half
bad
why
shouldn
t
we
open
it
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
was
i
mistaken
in
her
purpose
in
coming
or
was
this
proposal
to
open
the
house
the
clever
move
of
a
clever
gamester
to
force
me
to
speak
first
this
lovely
weather
she
went
on
it
s
a
shame
such
a
climate
should
be
wasted
upon
such
a
vulgar
city
when
i
think
of
the
dreadful
rains
that
infest
paris
and
the
rains
and
fogs
of
london
how
they
would
glory
in
this
sun
and
sparkling
air
to
my
notion
new
york
was
vastly
more
attractive
than
dreary
london
or
rainy
sloppy
paris
but
i
made
no
defense
of
new
york
i
wished
her
to
think
it
crude
and
tiresome
and
the
fashionable
society
here
she
went
on
what
a
silly
copy
of
the
real
thing
over
there
it
must
remind
you
of
passaic
said
i
she
visibly
shivered
i
was
suddenly
seized
of
a
base
inspiration
in
my
despair
i
did
not
hesitate
said
i
that
reminds
me
we
must
go
over
to
see
the
old
people
oh
yes
she
murmured
i
m
so
neglectful
i
felt
i
saw
that
i
was
on
the
right
track
at
last
when
will
you
go
i
persisted
next
sunday
perhaps
said
she
faintly
yes
we
ll
go
sunday
they
fret
because
you
never
write
they
are
well
in
splendid
health
there
s
no
reason
why
all
four
of
them
shouldn
t
outlive
us
you
you
go
often
she
faltered
i
haven
t
been
for
some
time
said
i
you
see
i
ve
been
away
if
we
opened
the
house
we
could
have
them
visit
us
that
would
make
up
to
them
for
the
way
we
ve
acted
she
gazed
at
me
in
large
eyed
horror
suddenly
she
smiled
with
patient
scorn
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
oh
i
had
forgotten
your
passion
for
jesting
i
am
in
earnest
said
i
and
i
was
indeed
in
the
full
flood
of
a
virtuous
penitence
whose
hypocrisy
i
did
not
detect
until
i
was
thinking
about
the
matter
afterwards
you
gentle
reader
would
in
the
same
circumstances
never
have
permitted
yourself
to
discover
the
hypocrisy
i
went
on
i
m
ashamed
of
the
way
i
ve
acted
they
ve
got
everything
they
need
or
want
said
edna
material
comfort
replied
i
but
haven
t
parents
a
right
to
expect
something
more
and
now
that
our
social
position
is
secure
we
ve
no
excuse
for
acting
snobbishly
i
enjoyed
this
virtuous
talk
for
itself
still
more
i
enjoyed
teasing
her
her
delicate
refined
ladylike
nerves
were
aristocratically
sensitive
have
you
observed
that
peculiarity
of
lady
nerves
a
lady
will
live
with
the
most
shocking
husband
for
luxury
she
will
endure
the
most
degrading
humiliations
to
get
dresses
jewels
motor
cars
she
will
crawl
in
the
dirt
to
gain
or
to
improve
social
position
she
will
without
a
quiver
kiss
her
worst
enemy
cut
her
dearest
friends
in
the
furtherance
of
any
ladylike
purpose
but
talk
to
her
of
self
respecting
independence
of
earning
her
own
living
or
of
any
of
the
homely
decencies
of
life
of
her
ignorant
old
parents
or
unsightly
poor
relatives
and
what
a
fairy
princess
of
high
strung
nerves
she
straightway
becomes
yes
edna
was
a
lady
a
perfect
lady
as
perfect
as
if
she
had
been
born
to
it
to
my
surprise
i
had
daunted
her
only
for
the
day
the
following
afternoon
she
began
again
this
heavenly
weather
she
exclaimed
it
tempts
me
to
stay
on
and
on
i
hope
it
will
last
over
sunday
said
i
she
ignored
the
shaft
and
went
on
with
undiminished
enthusiasm
and
really
new
york
has
improved
in
some
respects
it
can
be
compared
to
paris
though
of
course
it
has
no
background
a
city
can
be
built
in
a
generation
or
so
but
to
build
up
the
country
that
takes
centuries
it
s
building
up
rapidly
said
i
you
ll
be
astonished
sunday
by
the
change
down
where
the
old
folks
are
the
fosdicks
have
bought
up
twenty
farms
or
so
and
are
making
a
park
i
saw
amy
siersdorf
not
long
ago
and
she
spoke
of
having
stopped
at
father
s
place
and
got
milk
and
corn
bread
the
fluffy
little
cat
said
edna
not
especially
ruffled
i
shall
snub
her
the
first
time
we
meet
but
i
was
about
to
speak
of
our
house
i
am
arranging
to
open
it
of
course
margot
can
t
come
over
this
winter
but
i
don
t
really
need
her
we
owe
it
to
our
friends
here
to
do
something
socially
i
want
to
stop
the
gossip
the
gossip
said
i
the
talk
because
we
are
not
living
together
it
isn
t
dangerous
but
it
s
uncomfortable
i
believe
people
like
us
ought
to
maintain
the
best
social
traditions
ought
to
set
a
good
example
to
the
lower
classes
oh
bother
said
i
as
good
humoredly
as
i
could
we
ll
do
as
we
please
otherwise
where
s
the
use
in
having
money
a
pause
which
i
felt
was
hopeful
edna
said
with
affected
carelessness
you
don
t
think
people
have
a
right
to
to
divorce
at
last
my
intuition
had
been
correct
why
not
replied
i
my
tone
as
casual
as
hers
certainly
if
they
wish
a
long
silence
then
she
sometimes
i
feel
that
way
myself
when
two
people
find
that
they
re
uncongenial
that
they
d
be
better
off
happier
if
free
to
go
their
separate
ways
and
to
realize
to
the
full
their
own
ideals
of
life
why
not
precisely
my
view
said
i
again
a
long
silence
she
finally
said
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
godfrey
that
you
and
i
might
be
better
off
apart
i
laughed
it
s
a
good
many
years
now
since
we
were
together
replied
i
we
might
as
well
be
divorced
as
living
the
way
we
do
it
s
because
i
ve
been
feeling
those
very
things
that
i
ve
come
back
said
she
it
seemed
to
me
that
now
i
ve
fulfilled
my
duty
to
margot
i
ought
to
do
my
duty
to
you
that
s
like
you
said
i
for
you
life
is
one
long
sacrifice
if
she
scented
irony
she
dissembled
well
sacrifice
is
the
woman
s
part
replied
she
sweetly
no
doubt
i
went
on
you
re
willing
to
stay
here
where
you
re
unhappy
and
for
my
sake
to
jam
the
house
night
after
night
with
people
you
care
nothing
about
and
disport
yourself
in
splendor
to
make
the
world
envy
me
i
appreciate
your
nobility
of
character
but
i
positively
can
t
allow
it
we
must
do
our
duty
said
she
society
expects
certain
things
of
us
and
we
must
do
them
not
i
my
dear
open
the
house
if
you
like
but
i
stick
to
my
bachelor
apartment
do
you
want
me
to
go
back
to
europe
said
she
with
a
fine
show
of
quiet
melancholy
i
want
you
to
do
as
you
please
was
my
answer
but
unless
i
stay
here
and
you
and
i
take
our
place
in
society
together
i
she
hesitated
now
that
margot
is
settled
she
went
on
desperately
i
am
adrift
and
godfrey
we
can
t
go
on
as
we
are
i
see
that
said
i
what
do
you
propose
to
stay
in
new
york
replied
she
with
the
promptness
of
the
skilled
fencer
to
stay
here
and
be
the
mistress
of
your
establishment
my
establishment
is
an
apartment
at
sherry
s
but
that
s
impossible
remonstrated
she
be
calm
my
dear
i
don
t
ask
you
to
lead
my
kind
of
life
then
what
do
you
propose
ventured
she
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
settled
myself
more
comfortably
in
her
luxurious
motor
i
gazed
with
absorbed
interest
at
the
bunch
of
orchids
in
the
flower
holder
i
don
t
see
how
we
can
continue
neither
free
nor
bound
pursued
she
whatever
you
like
said
i
only
no
fashionable
capering
for
me
do
you
want
me
to
get
a
divorce
godfrey
said
she
i
want
you
to
be
happy
said
i
divorce
has
no
terrors
for
me
aren
t
we
practically
divorced
already
that
s
true
said
she
we
never
did
have
much
in
common
then
she
reddened
for
she
could
not
quite
forget
those
first
days
of
our
married
life
before
i
got
the
money
to
feed
her
ambition
you
make
me
feel
as
if
you
were
a
no
not
a
stranger
but
only
a
friend
and
we
are
friends
said
i
heartily
and
always
shall
be
for
i
was
beginning
to
like
her
to
take
the
amiably
indifferent
outsider
s
view
of
her
now
that
she
was
freeing
me
godfrey
do
you
want
to
marry
again
she
asked
with
a
sudden
shrewd
look
straight
into
my
eyes
i
laughed
easily
that
question
might
better
come
from
me
said
i
you
will
never
be
happy
i
suppose
until
you
are
the
duchess
or
princess
something
or
other
a
flush
stole
over
her
small
sweet
face
making
it
lovelier
than
ever
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
she
protested
but
too
energetically
nonsense
said
i
you
ve
dreamed
it
for
years
be
honest
with
me
edna
how
could
i
dream
it
replied
she
it
would
take
an
awful
lot
of
money
you
have
quite
a
bunch
said
i
and
if
we
parted
naturally
i
d
give
you
more
once
again
but
this
time
slowly
the
searching
gaze
turned
upon
me
i
bore
it
well
you
can
t
live
as
i
live
i
went
on
i
won
t
live
as
you
live
you
say
that
means
divorce
i
don
t
think
so
many
rich
american
couples
live
apart
without
divorce
i
believe
usually
the
reason
is
the
wife
has
found
she
couldn
t
get
a
large
enough
slice
of
the
husband
s
fortune
if
she
divorced
him
still
for
whatever
reason
they
stay
married
you
don
t
like
the
idea
so
i
say
if
you
want
to
go
i
ll
give
you
as
much
as
i
gave
margot
in
addition
to
what
you
already
have
and
my
blessing
i
ve
some
sentiment
about
the
past
but
it
is
as
a
past
i
am
stunned
said
she
and
i
think
her
vanity
was
it
s
what
you
want
rejoined
i
you
put
me
in
a
hard
position
godfrey
you
give
me
no
alternative
but
to
accept
i
am
a
hard
man
said
i
suavely
you
are
really
willing
to
let
me
go
you
expected
to
have
a
difficult
time
persuading
me
laughed
i
she
looked
at
me
reproachfully
do
be
serious
godfrey
about
these
serious
things
all
right
what
do
you
say
edna
yes
or
no
i
must
have
time
to
think
replied
she
this
is
a
very
solemn
moment
why
fake
said
i
pleasantly
you
have
it
all
thought
out
it
is
solemn
to
me
godfrey
there
s
nothing
solemn
about
our
married
life
it
s
a
farce
but
she
was
searching
for
confirmation
of
her
fear
of
some
kind
of
trap
you
really
mean
that
you
wish
to
free
me
she
said
i
mean
precisely
what
i
say
replied
i
freedom
and
the
cash
are
yours
for
the
asking
but
you
must
ask
my
dear
i
ll
not
have
any
more
of
your
favorite
comedy
of
making
yourself
out
a
martyr
you
don
t
know
how
you
hurt
me
cried
she
but
you
always
have
hurt
me
always
i
know
very
gently
that
you
didn
t
mean
to
but
you
haven
t
understood
i
did
my
best
said
i
with
the
pleasant
smile
of
which
she
was
so
intolerant
but
what
can
be
expected
of
a
plain
coarse
materialist
of
a
business
man
yet
you
are
generous
in
many
ways
mused
she
it
s
simply
that
you
can
t
understand
me
perhaps
it
s
you
that
don
t
understand
me
said
i
what
do
you
mean
inquired
she
oh
nothing
i
replied
carelessly
how
hope
to
make
a
vain
woman
obsessed
of
the
notion
that
she
has
a
profound
and
mysterious
soul
when
she
simply
has
a
fog
bank
how
hope
to
make
her
see
the
truth
about
herself
it
isn
t
worth
explaining
only
when
you
are
free
and
you
find
some
one
who
appreciates
and
sympathizes
with
that
soul
of
yours
be
careful
to
pay
him
well
and
to
keep
on
paying
you
can
always
be
flattered
and
fooled
if
you
pay
for
it
but
if
you
don
t
pay
look
out
you
may
hear
the
truth
what
a
cynic
you
are
she
cried
thank
god
i
haven
t
your
low
views
of
life
keep
your
views
by
all
means
said
i
but
don
t
forget
my
advice
you
are
lovely
you
are
charming
you
dress
beautifully
and
have
good
taste

it
s
the
money
my
dear
that
causes
the
excitement
about
those
charms
and
graces

on
to
your
principal
and
spend
your
income
freely
but
judiciously
if
i
could
only
convince
you
that
there
is
something
beside
money
in
the
world
not
for
those
to
whom
money
is
the
breath
of
life
replied
i
when
we
returned
to
her
hotel
she
urged
me
to
come
in
for
tea
we
went
into
the
greenroom
to
listen
to
the
music
and
to
observe
the
crowds
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
men
but
two
thirds
were
women
women
of
all
classes
and

happens
to
be
in
the
mood
in
which
he
succumbs
to
the

with
pleasure

said
my
wife
gazing
around
with
shining
eyes
and
inhaling
the
heavily
scented
atmosphere
with
dilating
nostrils
more
and
more
like
europe
more
and
more
replied
i
especially
the
women
oh
they
re
ahead
of
the
european
women
said
she
so
they
are
said
i
yes
they
beat
the
european
women
at
it
but
i
m
not
sure
whether
that
s
because
they
are
really
cleverer
or
merely
because
our
men
trim
more
readily
she
regarded
me
with
an
expression
of
mildly
interested
perplexity
as
if
she
couldn
t
imagine
what
was
the
it
i
was
talking
about
you
must
admit
they
are
lovely
said
she
admit
it
said
i
i
proclaim
it
if
a
man
s
notion
of
dinner
is
only
the
dessert
he
couldn
t
do
better
she
looked
still
more
vague
one
of
her
tricks
when
she
wished
to
avoid
or
to
ignore
i
never
touch
desserts
said
she
as
i
was
leaving
for
we
were
not
dining
together
that
evening
she
said
i
shall
think
about
your
proposal
i
looked
straight
at
her
tell
me
whether
you
will
or
will
not
confirm
your
own
proposal
said
i
and
don
t
delay
too
long
unfinished
business
makes
me
nervous
she
returned
my
look
with
quiet
composure
i
shall
let
you
know
to
morrow
said
she
x
among
my
acquaintances
both
in
and
out
of
fashionable
society
there
were
not
a
few
jealous
husbands
i
knew
one
man
who
in
the
evening
made
his
wife
account
for
every
moment
of
the
day
and
tell
him
in
detail
how
she
was
going
to
spend
the
following
day
and
during
business
hours
he
called
up
irregularly
on
the
telephone
he
was
not
content
with
the
effective
system
of
espionage
which
a
retinue
of
servants
automatically
establishes
another
man
to
give
a
typical
instance
of
each
of
the
two
types
hired
detectives
from
time
to
time
to
watch
his
wife
living
abroad
for
her
health
and
to
educate
her
children
in
a
decently
ordered
society
this
sort
of
jealousy
is
rare
only
where
the
women
are
luxuriously
supported
parasites
and
the
men
are
attaching
but
the
one
value
to
the
women
the
only
value
they
possess
for
them
only
there
do
you
find
this
defiling
jealousy
the
rule
instead
of
the
exception
naturally
if
the
woman
is
mere
property
the
man
guards
her
as
he
guards
the
rest
of
his
material
possessions
and
the
woman
who
consents
to
be
mere
property
probably
needs
guarding
if
she
has
qualities
of
desirability
discoverable
by
other
eyes
than
those
of
her
overprizing
owner
this
jealousy
was
in
the
air
of
the
offices
and
clubs
i
frequented
but
it
had
somehow
or
other
never
infected
me
was
i
occupied
too
deeply
with
other
matters
was
i
indifferent
did
my
own
disinclination
to
dalliance
make
me
slow
to
appreciate
the
large
part
dalliance
now
plays
in
american
life
i
do
not
know
why
i
was
free
from
jealousy
i
only
know
that
never
once
had
my
mind
been
shadowed
by
a
sinister
thought
as
to
what
my
wife
might
be
about
far
away
and
free
possibly
my
knowledge
of
her
absorption
in
social
ambition
kept
me
quiet
certainly
a
woman
whose
whole
mind
and
heart
are
set
upon
social
climbing
is
about
the
last
person
a
seeker
for
dalliance
would
invest
i
had
never
heard
a
word
or
a
hint
of
a
scandal
about
her
for
the
best
of
reasons
she
did
nothing
to
cause
that
kind
of
talk
but
how
curious
is
coincidence
on
the
very
evening
of
the
day
of
our
divorce
discussion
edna
had
her
first
experience
of
scandal
and
i
immediately
knew
of
it
after
leaving
her
i
went
to
the
federal
club
where
i
often
took
a
hand
in
a
rather
stiff
game
of
bridge
before
dinner
i
drifted
into
the
reading
room
glanced
idly
at
the
long
row
of
current
magazines
in
full
view
lay
the
weekly
purveyor
of
social
news
a
paper
i
had
not
looked
at
half
a
dozen
times
in
my
life
and
then
only
because
some
one
had
asked
me
to
read
a
particular
paragraph
the
week
s
issue
of
this
scandal
monger
had
just
come
in
i
threw
back
the
cover
let
my
glance
drop
upon
the
page
i
was
hardly
aware
that
i
was
reading
for
my
thoughts
were
elsewhere
when
i
became
vaguely
conscious
that
the
print
had
some
relation
to
me
i
reread
it
it
was
a
veiled
attack
upon
edna
all
unsuspected
by
her
husband
so
the
story
ran
she
had
come
to
america
to
divorce
him
that
she
might
marry
a
german
nobleman
of
almost
royal
rank
a
voice
close
beside
me
said
what
is
it
amuses
you
so
in
that
dirty
sheet
it
was
armitage
i
started
guiltily
then
my
common
sense
asserted
itself
and
i
pointed
to
the
paragraph
when
he
had
read
it
i
said
who
s
the
german
i
m
not
well
enough
up
on
the
nobility
to
be
able
to
guess
though
it
s
probably
plainly
told
the
count
von
biestrich
said
he
thanks
said
i
no
wiser
than
before
and
we
went
up
to
play
bridge
a
year
or
so
before
i
might
possibly
have
talked
freely
with
armitage
but
the
day
of
our
closest
intimacy
had
passed
he
was
still
my
intimate
friend
i
was
his
with
several
large
reservations
why
chiefly
because
when
he
passed
the
critical
age
his
mind
took
the
turn
for
the
worse
at
forty
to
forty
five
a
man
begins
to
reap
his
harvest
armitage
had
many
and
varied
interests
but
the
one
that
affected
his
nature
most
profoundly
was
women
he
mocked
at
them
he
was
always
inventing
or
relating
stories
about
them
of
the
more
or
less
gamey
sort
but
somewhat
like
his
pretensions
of
disdain
for
birth
and
fashion
his
wordy
scorn
of
women
concealed
a
slavish
weakness
for
them
after
forty
this
began
to
disclose
itself
in
his
features
their
handsome
intellectuality
began
to
be
marred
by
a
sensual
heaviness
and
presently
his
wit
degenerated
toward
a
repellent
coarseness
it
takes
delicate
juggling
to
make
filth
attractive
after
forty
a
man
does
well
to
be
careful
how
he
attempts
it
for
after
forty
the
hand
loses
its
lightness
i
rather
avoided
armitage
not
that
i
was
squeamish
but
my
sense
of
humor
somehow
rarely
has
responded
to
rude
rootings
and
pawings
in
the
garbage
barrel
about
an
hour
after
dinner
edna
called
me
to
the
telephone
and
asked
me
to
come
to
her
i
found
her
in
high
excitement
her
color
vivid
her
manner
nervous
beyond
its
natural
vivacity
even
as
now
expanded
upon
the
best
continental
models
i
got
rid
of
my
guests
said
she
and
sent
for
you
as
soon
as
i
could
have
you
heard
about
von
biestrich
said
i
it
is
hideous
hideous
she
cried
i
who
have
kept
my
name
unsullied
i
who
have
i
m
sure
of
that
i
interrupted
i
m
dead
tired
and
if
you
ll
excuse
me
i
ll
go
home
she
caught
me
by
the
arm
godfrey
you
think
this
was
what
i
had
in
mind
i
swear
to
you
i
m
sure
you
ve
been
all
that
a
wife
is
expected
to
be
said
i
in
my
usual
manner
of
good
natured
raillery
and
i
m
also
sure
you
would
wait
until
you
were
free
and
would
deliberate
very
carefully
before
deciding
godfrey
how
can
you
cried
she
in
her
most
exaggerated
tone
for
outraged
spirituality
have
you
no
heart
have
you
no
respect
for
me
your
wife
the
mother
of
your
daughter
have
i
not
said
i
did
not
suspect
you
remonstrated
i
why
so
agitated
my
dear
do
you
wish
to
make
me
begin
to
suspect
she
shrank
and
began
to
cool
down
i
ve
never
had
such
an
experience
before
she
apologized
i
don
t
know
how
to
take
it
it
s
nothing
nothing
i
declared
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
if
i
were
free
i
should
not
consider
marrying
that
german
i
believe
you
i
put
out
a
friendly
hand
good
night
this
ends
all
talk
of
divorce
said
she
i
dropped
my
hand
i
don
t
see
that
the
situation
is
changed
in
the
least
that
s
because
you
are
not
a
woman
replied
she
you
can
t
appreciate
how
i
feel
you
wished
to
be
free
before
this
paragraph
appeared
you
still
wish
to
be
free
oh
how
can
you
be
so
insensible
cried
she
all
unstrung
again
and
i
could
not
but
see
genuinely
so
i
never
could
face
the
scandal
of
a
divorce
i
didn
t
realize
it
would
kill
me
how
did
hilda
face
it
and
all
these
other
nice
women
i
should
hide
and
never
show
my
face
again
she
was
agitating
me
so
wildly
that
i
felt
i
could
not
much
longer
conceal
it
i
must
go
said
i
pretending
to
yawn
sleep
on
it
perhaps
to
morrow
you
ll
feel
differently
she
tried
to
detain
me
but
i
broke
away
and
fled
to
be
almost
free
and
then
to
have
freedom
snatched
away
not
out
of
reach
but
where
it
can
be
reached
easily
if
one
will
simply
stretch
out
his
hand
somewhat
ruthlessly
by
no
means
so
ruthless
as
my
wife
had
been
a
score
of
times
in
gaining
her
ends
without
regard
to
me
why
not
be
ruthless
had
she
not
been
ruthless
had
she
not
given
me
the
right
to
compel
her
to
free
me
more
did
she
not
herself
wish
to
be
free
and
was
she
not
now
restrained
not
by
consideration
for
me
not
by
any
decent
instinct
whatsoever
but
solely
by
a
snobbish
groveling
fear
of
public
opinion
a
senseless
fear
too
we
are
constantly
criticising
people
by
way
of
patting
ourselves
on
the
back
because
they
take
what
they
want
regardless
of
the
feelings
of
others
a
form
of
self
righteousness
as
shameless
as
common
for
we
happen
not
to
fancy
the
things
they
show
themselves
inconsiderate
and
swinish
about
but
when
we
really
do
want
a
thing
what
then
how
industrious
we
become
in
appeal
to
conscience
that
most
perfect
of
courtiers
to
show
us
how
just
and
right
it
is
that
we
should
have
this
thing
we
want
having
set
myself
drastically
to
cure
self
fooling
years
before
when
first
i
realized
how
dangerous
it
is
and
how
common
a
cause
of
failure
and
ruin
i
was
unable
to
conceal
from
myself
the
cruelty
of
forcing
edna
to
divorce
me
my
conscience
as
sly
a
sophist
and
flatterer
as
yours
gentle
reader
my
conscience
could
not
convince
me
cruel
things
i
had
never
done
that
is
not
directly
of
course
i
like
all
men
of
action
had
again
and
again
been
compelled
to
do
them
indirectly
but
not
by
my
own
direct
act
had
i
ever
made
any
human
being
suffer
i
would
not
begin
now
i
would
not
commit
the
stupidity
of
trying
to
found
my
happiness
upon
the
wretchedness
of
another
i
could
feel
the
withering
scorn
that
would
blaze
in
mary
kirkwood
s
honest
eyes
if
i
should
go
to
her
after
having
freed
myself
by
force
and
she
should
find
it
out
i
see
your
sarcastic
smile
gentle
reader
as
i
thus
ingenuously
confess
the
selfish
fear
that
was
the
hidden
spring
of
my
virtue
your
smile
betrays
your
shallowness
if
you
knew
human
nature
you
would
know
that
all
real
motives
are
selfish
the
differences
of
character
in
human
beings
are
not
differences
between
selfish
and
unselfish
they
are
differences
between
petty
short
sighted
selfishness
and
broad
far
sighted
selfishness
when
i
saw
edna
again
she
was
still
wavering
she
had
come
to
america
with
her
mind
made
up
for
divorce
if
i
could
by
hook
or
by
crook
be
induced
to
consent
she
had
been
frightened
by
this
attack
upon
her
frightened
as
only
those
who
live
a
life
of
complete
self
deception
can
be
frightened
by
a
sudden
and
public
holding
up
of
the
mirror
to
reflect
their
naked
selves
she
was
of
course
easily
able
to
convince
herself
that
her
own
motives
in
seeking
a
divorce
were
fine
and
high
and
self
martyring
but
she
could
now
see
no
way
to
convince
others
in
the
public
estimation
she
saw
she
would
be
classed
with
lady
blankenship
with
mrs
ramsdell
with
all
the
other
women
who
had
got
divorces
to
better
themselves
socially
or
financially
instead
of
dying
out
the
scandal
grew
the
daily
papers
took
up
the
hints
in
the
society
journal
s
veiled
paragraph
had
long
cabled
accounts
of
count
von
biestrich
of
his
attentions
to
edna
told
when
and
where
they
had
been
guests
at
the
same
ch
teaus
and
country
houses
made
it
appear
that
they
had
been
no
better
than
they
should
be
for
nearly
a
year
edna
was
prostrated
there
s
only
one
answer
to
these
attacks
she
said
to
me
you
must
give
up
your
apartment
and
move
to
this
hotel
we
must
open
the
house
and
live
in
it
together
and
entertain
together
i
was
not
unprepared
i
had
threshed
out
the
whole
matter
with
myself
had
made
my
choice
between
the
two
courses
open
to
me
or
rather
had
forced
myself
to
see
the
truth
that
there
was
in
decency
but
the
one
course
very
well
said
i
to
her
and
that
was
all
i
moved
to
the
plaza
the
same
day
i
was
seen
constantly
with
her
i
did
my
best
to
show
the
world
that
all
was
serene
between
us
in
fact
if
you
saw
us
during
those
scandal
clouded
days
you
may
have
thought
us
a
couple
on
a
honeymoon
behind
the
scenes
we
quarreled
about
anything
about
everything
about
nothing
as
people
do
when
forced
to
play
in
public
the
farce
of
billing
and
cooing
lovers
especially
if
one
of
them
has
not
the
faintest
glimmer
of
a
sense
of
humor
but
in
public
the
newspapers
soon
had
to
drop
their
campaign
of
slander
by
insinuation
so
it
came
to
pass
that
by
the
opening
of
the
season
edna
and
i
were
installed
in
the
big
house
decidedly
improved
now
thanks
to
the
collecting
both
of
ideas
and
of
things
she
had
done
abroad
and
we
were
giving
all
kinds
of
parties
with
me
taking
part
to
an
extent
i
should
have
laughed
at
beforehand
as
impossible
she
had
become
so
irritating
to
me
that
the
mere
sight
of
her
put
me
in
a
rage
have
you
ever
been
forced
into
intimate
daily
contact
with
a
nature
that
is
thoroughly
artificial
after
you
have
discovered
its
artificiality
its
lack
of
sincerity
its
vanity
and
pretense
and
sex
trickery
there
is
as
we
all
know
in
everyone
of
us
a
streak
of
artificiality
of
self
consciousness
a
fondness
for
posing
to
seem
better
than
we
are
but
somewhere
beneath
the
pose
there
is
usually
a
core
of
sincerity
a
genuine
individuality
perhaps
a
poor
thing
but
still
a
real
thing
it
may
be
there
was
this
reality
somewhere
in
edna
i
can
only
say
that
i
was
never
granted
a
sight
of
it
and
i
rather
suspect
that
she
like
most
of
the
fashion
rotted
women
and
men
had
lost
by
a
process
of
atrophy
through
suppression
and
disuse
the
last
fragment
of
reality
had
gabriel
s
trumpet
sounded
and
the
great
light
from
the
throne
revealed
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
it
would
have
penetrated
in
her
to
nothing
but
posing
within
posing
i
shall
get
no
sympathy
from
man
or
woman
or
fellow
beast
after
talking
thus
of
a
woman
and
a
lady
it
is
the
convention
to
speak
gallant
lies
to
and
about
women
and
to
treat
them
as
if
they
were
beneath
contempt
so
my
habit
of
treating
them
well
and
speaking
the
truth
about
them
will
be
condemned
and
denounced
with
the
triple
curse
well
i
shall
try
to
live
through
it
except
in
occasional
outbursts
when
her
rude
candor
toward
me
would
anger
me
into
retort
in
kind
i
concealed
my
feeling
about
her
i
knew
it
was
just
yet
i
was
ashamed
of
it
our
quarrels
were
all
surface
affairs
outbursts
of
irritation
the
blowing
off
of
surplus
steam
not
the
bursting
of
the
boiler
and
the
wrecking
of
the
machinery
if
you
happen
to
take
into
your
employ
any
of
the
servants
we
had
in
those
days
edna
s
maids
or
my
valet
or
any
other
of
the
menials
so
placed
that
they
could
spy
upon
our
innermost
privacy
i
am
confident
that
in
return
for
your
adroit
searching
questionings
you
will
hear
we
were
no
more
inharmonious
than
the
usual
married
couple
past
the
best
foot
foremost
stage
i
did
not
swear
at
her
she
did
not
throw
bric
brac
at
me
and
once
i
remember
when
i
had
a
bad
headache
she
stayed
home
from
the
opera
on
a
monday
night
too
to
read
to
me
it
is
true
the
new
dress
in
which
she
had
expected
to
show
herself
was
not
ready
but
that
is
a
detail
for
a
cynic
to
linger
upon
three
months
of
new
york
and
she
was
bored
to
extinction
i
had
confidently
been
expecting
this
i
watched
the
signs
of
it
with
gnawing
anxiety
for
i
was
very
near
to
the
end
of
my
good
behavior
if
possible
i
wished
to
stay
on
and
help
her
toward
a
rational
frame
of
mind
one
in
which
she
would
see
that
divorce
was
the
only
possible
solution
of
our
impossible
situation
but
i
began
to
fear
i
should
have
to
give
up
and
fly
to
hunt
or
to
inspect
western
mines
and
railways
she
was
bored
by
the
women
they
seemed
shallow
dabblers
in
culture
after
the
european
women
she
was
offended
by
their
nervousness
about
their
position
it
made
them
seem
common
in
contrast
with
the
europeans
born
swells
and
impregnably
ensconced
she
was
bored
by
the
men
by
their
fewness
by
the
insufferable
dullness
of
those
few
all
of
them
feeble
imitations
of
the
european
type
of
elegant
loafer
these
men
have
no
subtlety
she
cried
they
have
no
conversation
when
they
re
alone
with
a
woman
you
should
hear
them
try
to
flatter
they
are
as
different
from
the
european
men
as
as
as
a
fence
painter
from
an
artist
i
suggested
quite
that
said
she
and
i
saw
her
making
a
mental
note
of
the
comparison
for
future
use
one
of
her
best
tricks
really
i
prefer
the
business
men
to
them
but
one
cannot
get
the
business
men
what
a
country
where
everyone
who
has
any
brains
is
at
work
if
you
are
unhappy
here
why
not
go
abroad
said
i
amiably
margot
is
always
waiting
for
you
but
how
can
i
go
abroad
railed
she
there
ll
be
another
outbreak
of
scandal
was
ever
a
woman
so
wretchedly
placed
what
shall
i
do
if
i
had
some
one
to
advise
me
it
was
interesting
to
hear
her
determined
self
reliant
character
though
she
was
thus
confess
to
the
universal
weakness
of
the
female
sex
women
not
trained
to
act
for
themselves
can
hardly
overcome
this
fundamental
defect
that
is
why
you
so
often
see
an
apparently
and
probably
superior
woman
weaken
and
yield
where
a
distinctly
ordinary
man
would
be
strong
and
would
march
ahead
the
trouble
with
edna
was
that
she
had
no
definite
man
behind
her
spurring
her
on
to
action
in
all
she
had
done
from
the
beginning
of
our
married
life
she
had
felt
that
she
had
me
to
fall
back
on
should
emergency
arise
an
unconscious
dependence
one
she
would
have
scornfully
denied
but
none
the
less
real
in
this
affair
there
was
no
man
to
fall
back
on
i
saw
this
yet
i
refrained
from
giving
her
the
support
she
needed
and
all
but
asked
her
cry
if
i
had
some
one
to
advise
me
meant
if
i
had
some
one
to
give
me
the
courage
to
act
i
knew
what
it
meant
but
eager
though
i
was
to
be
quit
of
her
i
would
not
give
her
the
thrust
toward
divorce
that
would
have
put
into
her
the
courage
of
anger
and
of
the
feeling
that
she
was
a
martyr
to
my
brutality
why
did
i
hold
myself
in
check
candidly
i
do
not
know
i
distrust
the
suggestion
that
it
may
have
been
due
to
essential
goodness
of
heart
at
any
rate
i
did
restrain
myself
she
naturally
enough
misunderstood
and
she
proceeded
to
explain
it
to
the
gratifying
of
her
vanity
i
saw
in
her
eyes
in
her
way
of
treating
me
that
she
thought
me
her
secret
adorer
convinced
of
my
unworthiness
of
her
god
to
mortal
superiority
not
daring
openly
to
resist
her
desire
to
be
free
from
me
but
opposing
it
humbly
silently
i
saw
that
she
pitied
me
did
this
add
to
my
anger
not
in
the
least
i
have
a
perhaps
queer
sense
of
humor
i
rather
welcomed
the
chance
to
get
a
little
amusement
out
of
a
situation
otherwise
dreary
and
infuriating
curiously
enough
it
was
armitage
who
came
to
her
rescue
and
to
mine
bob
had
been
in
retirement
several
weeks
having
himself
rejuvenated
by
a
beauty
doctor
you
are
astonished
gentle
reader
perhaps
incredulous
that
a
man
of
his
position
high
both
socially
and
financially
should
stoop
to
such
triviality
not
a
woman
but
a
man
and
the
serious
masculine
sort
of
man
he
was
i
assure
you
but
you
being
a
confirmed
accepter
of
the

a

physical
vanity
is
in

course
if
you
are

your

physical
vanity

all
bob
armitage
was
not
vain
enough
to
fail
to
see
the
beginning
of
the
ravages
of
time
and
dissipation
another
man
would
have
looked
in
the
glass
and
would
have
seen
a
reflection
ever
handsomer
as
the
years
went
by
would
have
discovered
in
the
creases
and
crow
s
feet
and
lengthening
wattles
a
superb
beauty
of
manly
strength
of
character

at
last

the
face
bob
was
not
that
sort
of
fool
he
wished
to
fascinate
the
ladies
so
he
strove
to
retain
the
fair
insignia
of
youth
as
long
as
he
possibly
could
he
knew
as
well
as
the
next
man
that
his
wealth
had
value
with
the
women
far
beyond
any
degree
of
beauty
or
charm
but
like
most
men
he
wished
to
feel
that
he
was
at
least
not
a
winner
in
spite
of
his
personal
self
and
his
young
good
looks
even
helped
toward
the
pleasantest
of
delusions
that
he
was
loved
for
himself
chiefly
the
beauty
doctor
did
well
by
him
i
must
say
he
looked
ten
years
younger
would
have
passed
in
artificial
light
for
a
youth
of
thirty

thereabouts

powerfully
upon
the
mind
and
while
it
is
true
that
feeling
young
helps
one
to
look
young
it
is
truer
that
looking

with

came
a
prince
frascatoni
head
of
one
of
the
great
families
of
italy
one
of
the
few
that
have
retained
german
titles
and
estates
from
the
days
of
the
holy
roman
empire
frascatoni
was
sufficiently
rich
for
all
ordinary
purposes
and
could
therefore
pose
as
a
traveler
for
pleasure
with
no
matrimonial
designs
he
was
in
fact
poor
for
a
grand
seigneur
and
was
on
the
same
business
in
america
that
has
attracted
here
every
other
visiting
foreigner
of
rank
except
those
who
come
for
political
purposes
and
those
who
come
to
shoot
in
the
west
and
those
classes
give
our
fashionable
society
as
wide
a
berth
as
they
would
its
middle
class
prototype
in
their
home
countries
the
first
time
i
saw
frascatoni
when
he
and
armitage
strolled
into
the
reading
room
of
the
federal
club
together
i
thought
him
about
the
handsomest
and
in
a
certain
way
the
most
distinguished
looking
man
i
had
ever
seen
he
was
a
black
italian
dark
olive
skin
coal
black
hair
dark
gray
eyes
that
seemed
black
or
brown
at
a
glance
they
were
weary
looking
eyes
they
gazed
at
you
with
the
ineffable
dreamy
satiric
repose
of
a
sphinx
who
has
seen
the
futile
human
procession
march
into
the
grave
for
countless
centuries
he
had
a
slow
sweet
smile
a
manner
made
superior
by
the
effacement
of
every
trace
of
superiority
he
had
the
quiet
leisurely
voice
of
one
used
to
being
listened
to
attentively
loring
the
prince
frascatoni
prince
i
particularly
wish
you
to
know
my
friend
godfrey
loring
don
t
be
deceived
by
his
look
of
the
honest
simple
youth
into
thinking
him
either
young
or
unsophisticated
the
prince
gave
me
his
hand
as
it
had
also
been
my
habit
ever
since
i
learned
the
valuable
trick
merely
to
give
my
hand
the
gesture
was
a
draw
neither
had
trapped
the
other
into
making
an
advance
we
talked
commonplaces
of
new
york
sky
line
american
energy
and
business
enthusiasm
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
then
we
three
and
some
one
else
a
professional
cultivator
of
millionaires
named
chassory
i
believe
played
bridge
and
afterwards
dined
together
it
came
out
sometime
during
the
evening
that
frascatoni
had
met
my
wife
in
rome
and
in
paris
and
that
he
knew
my
son
in
law
not
surprising
as
the
fashionable
set
is
international
and
is
small
enough
to
be
acquainted
all
round
armitage
must
have
told
him
that
my
wife
and
i
were
not
altogether
inconsolable
if
we
did
not
see
too
much
of
each
other
for
the
prince
taking
edna
in
to
dinner
a
few
nights
later
laid
siege
at
once
i
recall
noting
how
he
would
talk
to
her
in
his
quiet
leisurely
way
until
she
looked
at
him
then
how
his
weary
eyes
would
suddenly
light
up
with
interest
not
with
ardor
nothing
so
banal
as
that
but
a
fleeting
gleam
of
interest
that
was
more
flattering
than
the
ardor
of
another
man
would
have
been
as
frascatoni
an
unusual
type
attracted
me
i
saved
myself
from
boredom
by
observing
him
all
evening
and
it
was
highly
instructive
in
the
art
of
winning
whether
women
or
men
to
see
how
he
led
her
on
to
try
to
make
that
fascinating
fugitive
gleam
reappear
in
his
eyes
i
afterwards
discovered
that
he
accompanied
the
gleam
with
a
peculiar
veiled
caress
of
inflection
in
his
calm
even
voice
a
trick
that
doubly
re
nforced
the
flattery
of
the
gleam
what
a
charming
man
prince
frascatoni
is
said
my
wife
when
our
guests
were
gone
very
said
i
if
i
were
writing
a
novel
i
d
make
him
the
hero
or
the
villain
he
is
one
of
the
greatest
nobles
in
europe
he
looks
it
and
acts
it
said
i
why
i
thought
him
very
simple
and
natural
protested
she
exactly
said
i
so
many
of
the
nobles
i
ve
met
looked
and
acted
like
frauds
they
seemed
afraid
it
wouldn
t
be
known
that
they
were
of
the
aristocracy
you
are
prejudiced
said
edna
then
why
do
i
size
up
frascatoni
so
well
you
happen
to
like
him
but
i
don
t
replied
i
of
course
not
said
edna
with
sarcasm
he
isn
t
in
business
precisely
i
answered
he
couldn
t
do
anything
build
a
railroad
run
a
factory
write
a
book
paint
a
picture
he
and
his
kind
are
simply
amateurs
at
life
and
their
pretense
that
they
could
be
professionals
if
they
chose
ought
to
deceive
nobody
he
probably
could
ride
a
horse
a
little
worse
than
a
professional
jockey
or
handle
a
foil
almost
as
well
as
a
fencing
master
or
play
on
the
piano
or
the
violin
passably
i
don
t
admire
that
sort
of
people
and
i
can
t
like
where
i
don
t
admire
edna
yawned
and
prepared
to
go
up
to
her
own
rooms
i
hope
he
ll
stay
a
while
said
she
and
i
hope
he
ll
let
me
see
something
of
him
he
s
the
first
ray
of
interest
i
ve
had
this
winter
you
will
see
something
of
him
said
i
he
liked
you
you
think
so
said
she
seating
herself
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
i
know
it
unless
he
finds
what
he
s
looking
for
he
ll
attach
himself
to
you
what
is
he
looking
for
a
very
rich
wife
said
i
but
she
must
be
attractive
as
well
as
rich
armitage
tells
me
frascatoni
doesn
t
need
money
badly
enough
to
annex
a
frump
and
armitage
says
that
while
englishmen
and
germans
and
the
heiress
hunting
sort
of
french
don
t
care
a
rap
what
the
lady
looks
like
the
italians
of
the
old
families
are
rather
particular
not
exacting
but
particular
unless
of
course
the
fortune
is
huge
edna
yawned
again
that
sort
of
talk
either
irritated
or
bored
her
frascatoni
was
constantly
with
her
thenceforth
not
pointedly
or
scandalously
so
there
are
discreet
ways
of
doing
those
things
and
of
discretion
in
all
its
forms
the
italian
was
a
supreme
master
the
game
of
man
and
woman
had
been
his
especial
game
from
precocious
and
maddeningly
handsome
boyhood
he
had
learned
both
by
being
conquered
and
by
conquering
they
say
and
i
believe
it
that
of
all
the
foreigners
a
clean
italian
nobleman
is
the
most
fascinating
the
hungarian
or
russian
is
a
wild
barbaric
love
maker
the
german
a
wordy
sentimentalist
the
englishman
dominates
and
absorbs
the
frenchman
knows
how
to
flatter
the
most
subtly
how
to
make
the
woman
feel
that
life
with
him
would
be
full
of
interest
and
charm
but
the
right
sort
of
italian
combines
the
best
of
all
these
qualities
and
adds
to
them
the
allure
of
the
unfathomably
mysterious
he
constantly
satisfies
yet
always
baffles
he
reveals
himself
only
to
disclose
in
the
inner
wall
of
what
seemed
to
be
his
innermost
self
a
strangely
carved
door
ajar
my
first
intimation
of
what
frascatoni
was
about
came
from
my
wife
not
words
of
course
but
actions
she
abruptly
ceased
quarreling
rebuking
reproaching
scoffing
she
soothed
sympathized
agreed
she
became
as
sweet
as
she
had
formerly
been
i
was
puzzled
and
waited
for
light
it
came
with
her
next
move
she
began
to
talk
of
going
back
to
europe
to
deplore
that
scandalmongers
would
not
let
her
she
began
to
chaff
me
on
my
love
of
a
bachelor
s
life
on
my
dislike
of
married
life
she
said
with
reproachful
yet
smiling
gentleness
that
i
made
her
feel
ashamed
to
stay
on
admit
said
she
that
you
d
be
better
pleased
if
i
were
in
guinea
you
oughtn
t
have
given
me
so
many
years
of
freedom
said
i
you
d
have
been
glad
if
i
had
gone
on
and
gotten
a
divorce
pursued
she
my
drowsing
soul
startled
and
listened
i
was
willing
that
you
should
do
as
you
liked
said
i
divorce
is
a
matter
of
more
importance
to
the
woman
than
to
the
man
just
as
marriage
is
and
it
s
a
sensible
thing
too
isn
t
it
very
said
i
godfrey
would
you
honestly
be
willing
i
d
not
lay
a
straw
in
your
way
what
nonsense
we
re
talking
cried
she
with
a
nervous
laugh
and
yet
there
s
no
denying
that
we
don
t
get
on
together
i
see
how
trying
it
is
to
you
to
have
me
about
and
you
want
to
be
free
and
living
abroad
i
wonder
how
much
i
d
really
mind
the
scandal
pursued
she
i
don
t
care
especially
about
these
new
york
people
and
at
the
worst
what
harm
could
they
do
me
none
said
i
they
could
only
talk
how
they
d
blame
me
behind
your
back
perhaps
said
i
unless
they
thought
i
was
to
blame
which
is
more
likely
you
talk
of
divorce
as
if
it
were
nothing
it
s
merely
a
means
to
an
end
said
i
you
ve
got
only
the
one
life
you
know
and
i
m
no
longer
so
dreadfully
young
though
i
heard
that
armitage
said
the
other
day
he
would
never
dream
i
was
over
twenty
eight
if
he
didn
t
know
she
laughed
with
the
pleasure
we
all
take
in
a
compliment
that
is
genuine
for
she
knew
as
well
as
did
armitage
that
she
could
pass
for
twenty
eight
and
a
radiant
twenty
eight
even
in
her
least
lovely
hour
no
one
has
youth
to
waste
observed
i
in
your
heart
you
wish
to
be
free
don
t
you
we
are
not
suited
to
each
other
godfrey
said
she
with
gentle
friendliness
there
s
not
a
doubt
of
that
said
i
why
should
we
spoil
each
other
s
lives
i
conceal
it
from
you
but
i
am
so
unhappy
here
you
can
t
blame
me
said
i
i
m
not
detaining
you
a
long
silence
then
she
said
suppose
i
were
to
consent
i
laughed
she
reddened
corrected
herself
suppose
we
were
to
decide
to
do
it
what
then
why
a
divorce
said
i
can
t
those
things
be
done
quietly
certainly
no
publicity
until
the
decree
is
entered
and
the
papers
sealed
does
that
mean
no
scandal
beyond
just
the
fact
no
scandal
at
all
just
the
fact
and
some
newspaper
comment
and
we
needn
t
be
here
not
then
would
it
take
long
i
reflected
let
me
see
if
you
begin
action
say
within
a
month
the
divorce
would
take
i
could
have
it
pushed
through
in
another
month
or
so
and
then
by
next
fall
you
d
be
free
but
doesn
t
one
have
to
have
grounds
for
divorce
beside
not
wanting
to
be
married
all
that
easily
arranges
itself
said
i
she
lapsed
into
a
deep
study
i
furtively
watching
her
i
saw
an
expression
of
fright
at
the
daring
of
her
thoughts
gather
fright
yet
fascination
too
said
she
in
a
low
voice
godfrey
are
you
serious
entirely
so
was
my
careless
reply
aren
t
you
i
don
t
know
whether
i
am
or
not
i
am
wretched
here
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
say
the
word
we
don
t
in
the
least
need
each
other
and
mutual
need
is
the
only
respectable
excuse
for
marriage
and
i
must
tell
you
i
ll
not
stand
for
any
more
of
this
social
nonsense
that
compels
me
to
participate
i
m
done
she
looked
at
me
pityingly
our
season
had
been
a
brilliant
success
yet
i
remained
unconverted
coarsely
unsympathetic
if
i
should
decide
to
to
do
it
what
then
nothing
i
d
go
away
the
rest
would
be
for
the
lawyers
she
looked
at
me
dazedly
i
ll
see
i
ll
see
she
said
and
went
to
her
own
part
of
the
house
a
week
passed
frascatoni
sailed
for
home
sending
by
her
his
polite
regrets
at
not
having
seen
me
before
his
departure
i
waited
confident
i
knew
she
had
a
definite
goal
at
last
and
therefore
a
definite
purpose
aside
from
the
danger
of
frightening
her
back
by
showing
my
own
eagerness
there
was
the
matter
of
property
i
was
willing
to
pay
a
good
round
price
for
freedom
i
have
always
hated
money
wrangles
i
had
never
had
one
with
her
and
i
did
not
purpose
to
have
on
the
other
hand
that
is
on
her
side
she
would
have
given
me
short
shrift
had
it
not
been
that
she
wished
a
slice
of
my
fortune
and
a
generous
slice
to
add
to
her
own
i
ve
not
a
doubt
that
the
fierce
social
campaign
she
put
me
through
that
winter
was
not
so
much
for
her
own
pleasure
though
she
delighted
in
it
as
for
goading
me
to
demand
a
divorce
and
so
enable
her
to
ease
her
conscience
and
to
drive
a
better
bargain
my
seeming
indifference
combined
with
her
now
trembling
eagerness
to
be
free
and
away
soon
forced
her
hand
the
break
came
on
a
sunday
afternoon
life
is
so
inartistic
that
is
from
the
standpoint
of
the
cheap
novelists
and
playwrights
with
their
dramatic
claptrap
here
is
how
the
grand
crash
was
precipitated
said
i
well
i
m
off
for
a
few
weeks
fishing
you
re
not
starting
now
said
she
day
after
to
morrow
said
i
but
i
ve
made
several
engagements
for
you
get
a
substitute
said
i
no
one
will
miss
me
how
inconsiderate
you
are
that
s
pretty
good
after
all
i
ve
borne
this
winter
you
are
insufferable
cried
she
then
why
suffer
me
said
i
coolly
if
you
torture
me
much
further
i
won
t
retorted
she
i
think
i
ll
clear
out
to
night
said
i
with
people
coming
to
dinner
to
morrow
a
big
dinner
yes
to
night
said
i
i
had
forgotten
to
morrow
s
horrors
if
i
were
free
that
s
easy
yes
i
will
be
free
i
ll
send
you
a
lawyer
at
eleven
to
morrow
morning
she
was
pale
and
trembling
the
quarrel
was
a
mere
pretense
a
pretext
so
flimsy
that
each
knew
the
other
was
not
deceived
by
it
her
tones
of
anger
my
tones
of
abrupt
and
contemptuous
indifference
were
obviously
false
and
forced
as
i
left
the
room
i
cast
a
furtive
glance
at
her
saw
that
her
daring
was
so
terrifying
her
that
she
could
hardly
keep
a
plausible
front
of
haughty
anger
it
was
several
hours
before
i
could
get
away
from
the
house
though
i
made
all
haste
every
moment
i
expected
some
word
from
her
but
none
came
i
sent
the
lawyer
the
following
morning
i
was
surprised
when
later
in
the
day
by
the
necessary
roundabout
way
i
learned
that
she
had
actually
consented
she
showed
that
she
had
made
an
exhaustive
study
of
the
subject
like
the
wise
campaigner
she
was
she
thoroughly
understood
how
to
proceed
for
she
told
her
lawyer
the
one
of
my
lawyers
whom
i
assigned
to
her
that
my
coldness
to
her
had
filled
her
with
suspicion
and
that
she
wished
detectives
employed
she
needed
no
coaching
whatever
he
found
her
prepared
on
every
point
how
far
had
matters
gone
between
her
and
frascatoni
not
so
far
as
you
imagine
but
perhaps
farther
than
i
think
both
the
husband
and
the
world
are
poor
judges
in
those
affairs
i
shall
pass
over
the
suit
it
was
commonplace
throughout
there
has
been
much
speculation
as
to
the
person
named
by
my
wife
in
the
sealed
papers
i
can
truthfully
say
that
i
know
as
little
about
that
person
as
does
the
public
it
is
usually
so
i
believe
in
these
arranged
suits
i
did
not
appear
at
any
of
the
hearings
all
of
them
held
secretly
nor
did
edna
appear
though
i
believe
that
to
comply
with
the
forms
of
law
she
made
some
sort
of
deposition
in
the
presence
of
the
lawyers
for
both
sides
it
so
happened
that
the
first
and
only
public
step
the
judge
s
ordering
of
the
decree
of
divorce
was
published
on
the
same
day
with
the
news
of
a
big
prize
fight
a
sensational
murder
and
a
terrific
earthquake
so
we
got
off
with
little
public
attention
at
the
time
the
law
provided
that
a
decree
should
not
become
valid
for
six
months
we
were
nominally
free
but
actually
neither
could
marry
again
for
six
months
and
meanwhile
either
of
us
could
reopen
the
case
and
she
could
by
merely
requesting
put
an
end
to
it
and
restore
her
status
as
my
wife
so
i
was
free
unless
edna
should
change
her
mind
sometime
within
the
six
months
edna
was
in
london
and
i
in
paris
when
the
news
came
curiously
enough
as
i
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
ritz
restaurant
that
evening
looking
about
for
a
table
where
i
could
dine
alone
in
came
prince
frascatoni
with
another
italian
whose
name
i
cannot
recall
i
bowed
to
frascatoni
he
said
you
are
alone
sir
unluckily
yes
replied
i
he
introduced
his
companion
and
suggested
that
we
three
dine
at
the
same
table
why
not
share
our
dinner
said
he
i
can
easily
change
my
order
perhaps
you
will
go
with
us
afterwards
to
some
amusing
little
plays
in
a
montmartre
theater
i
accepted
the
courteous
invitation
the
situation
appealed
to
my
sense
of
humor
also
i
knew
that
edna
toward
whom
i
now
felt
most
kindly
would
be
delighted
to
read
in
the
papers
prince
frascatoni
had
as
his
guest
at
dinner
last
night
mr
godfrey
loring
it
would
put
an
immediate
stop
to
any
tendency
to
gossip
as
the
prince
did
not
speak
of
my
former
wife
i
assumed
that
he
had
heard
the
news
when
we
were
separating
i
said
you
will
dine
with
me
to
morrow
night
unfortunately
i
m
leaving
town
in
the
morning
said
he
i
thought
i
could
guess
which
way
he
was
journeying
with
perhaps
a
twinkle
in
my
eyes
i
said
so
soon
well
thank
you
and
good
by
and
good
luck
i
thought
i
saw
a
sardonic
smile
flit
over
his
face
he
probably
imagined
i
was
in
the
dark
as
to
his
maneuverings
and
designs
and
smiled
to
himself
as
he
thought
how
differently
this
american
would
be
treating
me
if
he
knew
do
not
fancy
because
edna
had
no
charm
for
me
i
thought
it
strange
she
should
have
charm
for
other
men
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
i
appreciated
her
attractive
points
perhaps
more
than
any
other
man
possibly
could
also
i
appreciated
and
still
appreciate
that
another
man
would
not
be
so
peculiarly
annoyed
by
her
lack
of
any
sense
of
humor
as
i
was
indeed
had
not
circumstances
forced
me
into
the
acutely
critical
mood
toward
her
i
doubt
not
i
could
have
continued
to
bear
with
that
lack
though
it
made
conversation
with
her
all
but
impossible
and
precipitated
quarrels
without
number
beyond
question
the
strongest
and
most
enduring
hold
a
man
can
get
upon
a
woman
or
a
woman
upon
a
man
is
the
physical
we
even
the
least
intellectual
of
us
are
something
more
than
physical
but
the
physical
must
be
contented
first
and
must
remain
contented
because
we
are
first
of
all
physical
the
physical
is
the
fundamental
but
it
takes
more
than
foundations
to
make
a
house
and
a
marriage
such
as
ours
was
could
not
endure
each
of
us
had
but
the
one
charm
for
the
other
it
wore
itself
out
like
a
fire
that
is
not
supplied
with
fuel
if
i
had
not
fallen
in
love
with
another
woman
there
might
have
remained
a
feeling
for
edna
that
would
have
made
me
jealous
perhaps
domineering
toward
her
as
it
was
i
viewed
her
calmly
when
i
said
good
luck
to
frascatoni
i
meant
it
i
hoped
he
would
make
edna
happy
for
i
wished
her
well
through
armitage
i
had
provided
myself
with
mary
kirkwood
s
address
an
apartment
overlooking
the
parc
monceau
which
she
and
neva
armstrong
had
taken
for
the
spring
months
that
very
afternoon
i
went
to
leave
cards
as
i
feared
she
was
not
at
home
but
said
mrs
armstrong
you
may
find
her
walking
in
the
park
with
hartley
beechman
oh
is
he
here
said
i
naturally
replied
she
you
may
picture
me
as
suddenly
dashed
down
by
this
word
whose
meaning
there
was
no
mistaking
if
so
you
have
discovered
little
about
me
in
these
pages
life
had
made
me
a
competent
judge
of
the
situation
that
is
really
hopeless
the
situation
where
to
struggle
is
folly
and
that
situation
which
seems
hopeless
to
the
small
of
earth
accustomed
to
defeat
in
their
desires
but
seems
only
difficult
to
the
other
sort
of
human
beings
he
has
taken
a
studio
over
in
the
latin
quarter
continued
mrs
armstrong
we
are
all
going
back
together
in
july
mrs
armstrong
is
an
attractive
woman
singularly
so
for
one
who
is
obviously
wholly
absorbed
in
her
husband
she
has
the
sort
of
personality
her
paintings
prepare
you
to
expect
but
i
had
difficulty
in
concealing
my
impatience
to
get
away
i
strolled
several
times
through
the
park
which
is
not
large
before
i
finally
came
upon
mary
and
beechman
seated
in
one
of
the
less
frequented
paths
as
i
was
moving
directly
toward
them
both
saw
me
at
the
same
instant
her
welcoming
smile
was
radiant
i
did
not
notice
his
but
i
assume
it
was
more
reserved
never
had
i
seen
her
looking
so
well
you
may
say
what
you
please
but
an
american
woman
who
knows
how
to
dress
in
touch
with
a
french
dressmaker
who
is
rather
artist
than
dressmaker
is
the
supreme
combination
for
sthetic
beauty
mrs
kirkwood
of
the
ivory
skin
and
the
coal
black
hair
was
a
thrilling
sight
to
see
in
her
white
dress
and
big
black
hat
with
that
background
of
fresh
spring
foliage
and
late
afternoon
light
her
eyes
and
her
smile
i
noted
for
the
first
time
had
somewhat
the
same
quality
as
frascatoni
s
the
weary
eyes
the
slow
sweet
smile
mr
loring
she
cried
rising
and
extending
her
hand
impulsively
i
thought
i
was
never
to
see
you
again
i
hid
my
emotion
and
greeted
her
then
beechman
in
my
habitual
manner
which
they
tell
me
is
the
reverse
of
effusive
i
suppose
when
i
am
deeply
moved
its
lack
of
cordiality
becomes
even
more
pronounced
after
a
few
minutes
of
the
talk
necessary
among
acquaintances
who
have
not
met
in
a
long
time
beechman
rose
you
and
beechman
will
dine
with
me
i
hope
i
said
mrs
armstrong
says
she
will
go
if
you
can
it
was
arranged
and
as
the
day
was
warm
d
armenonville
was
fixed
upon
as
the
place
until
half
past
eight
said
beechman
as
he
left
mary
and
i
sat
silent
watching
him
walk
away
a
superb
figure
of
young
manhood
supremely
fortunate
in
that
his
body
was
an
adequate
expression
of
a
strong
and
simple
nature
as
he
passed
from
view
at
the
turn
of
the
walk
i
transferred
my
gaze
to
her
her
eyes
slowly
lowered
and
a
faint
flush
came
into
her
cheeks
said
i
you
saw
the
news
about
me
hartley
and
i
were
talking
of
it
as
you
appeared
you
were
not
surprised
yes
and
no
replied
she
with
constraint
and
some
confusion
a
year
or
so
ago
i
people
thought
you
and
she
had
had
drifted
apart
then
it
looked
as
though
you
had
come
together
again
it
seemed
the
natural
thing
she
is
beautiful
and
has
so
much
charm
she
was
unhappy
in
america
she
wished
to
be
free
mary
looked
at
me
reflectively
you
are
not
inconsolable
i
see
said
she
with
a
smile
of
faint
raillery
my
brother
has
often
told
me
about
you
how
indifferent
you
are
to
women
perhaps
that
is
why
you
are
attractive
to
them
am
i
said
i
i
did
not
know
it
you
are
terribly
impersonal
she
went
on
laughingly
last
summer
i
well
i
was
not
that
is
not
exactly
trying
to
flirt
with
you
but
your
absolute
unconsciousness
of
me
as
a
woman
was
often
very
baffling
i
laughed
you
thought
that
how
could
i
help
seeing
it
why
you
treated
me
precisely
as
if
i
were
another
man
not
that
i
didn
t
like
it
on
the
whole
a
woman
gets
tired
of
being
always
on
guard
she
smiled
at
herself
that
sounds
horribly
conceited
but
you
know
what
i
mean
the
men
never
lose
a
chance
to
practice
then
too
well
if
a
woman
has
the
reputation
of
being
rich
she
need
not
flatter
herself
that
it
is
her
charms
that
do
all
the
drawing
that
s
the
supreme
curse
of
money
it
all
but
cuts
one
off
from
love
and
friendship
fortunately
it
to
a
great
extent
takes
the
place
of
them
i
don
t
like
to
hear
you
say
that
said
she
how
many
poor
people
get
love
and
friendship
replied
i
isn
t
it
the
truth
that
there
is
little
very
very
little
real
love
or
friendship
in
the
world
all
i
meant
was
that
money
and
the
independence
and
comfort
and
the
counterfeit
of
affection
it
brings
are
better
than
nothing
at
all
oh
i
see
said
she
you
are
so
sensible
and
you
don
t
cant
that
was
why
i
liked
to
talk
with
you
at
first
i
thought
you
cynical
and
hard
that
s
the
first
impression
plain
good
sense
makes
we
are
used
to
hearing
only
shallow
sentimentality
the
unending
flapdoodle
said
i
flapdoodle
agreed
she
then
i
began
to
discover
that
you
were
anything
but
hard
that
you
looked
at
people
as
they
are
and
liked
them
for
themselves
not
for
what
they
pretended
to
be
i
was
beginning
to
trust
you
to
venture
timidly
in
the
direction
of
being
my
natural
self
when
you
left
well
here
i
am
again
said
i
and
we
start
in
afresh
she
smiled
with
embarrassment
yes
she
said
hesitatingly
but
the
circumstances
have
changed
somewhat
i
know
full
well
now
what
i
should
have
said
i
should
have
replied
yes
we
are
both
almost
free
but
soon
will
be
altogether
free
i
in
six
months
you
as
soon
as
you
break
your
engagement
that
would
have
been
bold
and
intelligent
for
it
is
always
intelligent
to
make
the
issue
clear
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
but
i
did
not
speak
i
remained
silent
why
because
as
i
was
talking
with
her
i
was
realizing
that
i
had
been
deceiving
myself
in
a
curious
fashion
i
had
been
so
concentratedly
in
love
with
her
gentle
reader
i
see
the
mocking
smile
on
your
shallowly
sentimental
face
you
are
ridiculing
a
love
that
could
have
such
restraint
as
mine
that
could
bear
with
edna
could
wait
could
refrain
from
any
of
the
familiar
much
admired
impetuosities
and
follies
you
cannot
understand
in
this
day
when
men
no
longer
regard
or
feel
their
responsibilities
in
taking
a
more
or
less
helpless
woman
to
wife
your
sense
of
the
decencies
is
utterly
corrupted
but
let
me
say
that
no
matter
how
ardently
and
romantically
a
man
may
conduct
himself
a
woman
would
do
well
to
take
care
how
she
trusts
him
if
he
has
a
bad
or
even
a
doubtful
record
as
to
his
way
of
meeting
his
responsibilities
of
whatever
sort
that
kind
of
love
may
listen
good
but
it
does
not
live
good
however
as
i
was
about
to
say
when
your
smile
interrupted
me
my
all
absorbing
love
for
mary
kirkwood
had
misled
me
into
assuming
with
no
reason
whatsoever
that
she
understood
all
that
she
knew
i
was
eager
to
come
to
her
and
would
come
as
soon
as
i
could
you
will
say
this
was
absurd
granted
but
is
not
a
man
in
love
always
absurd
you
will
say
it
was
egotistical
granted
but
is
not
a
man
in
love
always
egotistical
it
is
not
the
realities
but
the
delusions
that
keep
us
going
and
in
those
long
months
of
waiting
of
hoping
often
against
hope
i
had
to
have
a
delusion
to
keep
me
going
but
now
her
friendly
simply
friendly
way
of
talking
to
me
made
me
see
that
i
had
her
yet
to
win
that
i
could
not
speak
out
directly
as
i
had
planned
you
who
probably
know
women
well
may
say
that
this
was
a
mistake
perhaps
nevertheless
i
could
not
have
done
otherwise
you
will
say
that
women
do
not
know
their
own
minds
but
have
to
be
told
i
admit
it
you
will
say
my
silence
was
timidity
i
admit
it
i
could
not
talk
of
love
to
a
woman
until
i
was
sure
she
wished
to
hear
i
had
the
timidity
of
the
man
to
whom
woman
and
love
are
serious
matters
the
timidity
unknown
to
the
man
who
makes
love
to
every
passable
female
at
whom
he
has
a
chance
the
timidity
which
all
women
profess
to
approve
but
which
i
more
than
suspect
appeals
only
to
the
jaded
palate
of
the
woman
who
has
long
made
love
and
passion
her
profession
as
beechman
was
busy
with
a
novel
i
had
everything
my
own
way
without
strategy
during
those
following
days
there
are
a
thousand
attractive
places
to
go
in
and
near
paris
and
i
was
resourceful
in
contriving
excursions
for
the
days
when
there
was
no
chance
of
seeing
only
her
almost
every
day
the
london
papers
or
the
paris
herald
printed
something
about
edna
and
the
brilliant
season
she
was
having
in
london
often
not
far
away
from
her
name
in
a
list
of
guests
was
the
name
of
prince
frascatoni
my
own
activities
more
bohemian
as
was
my
taste
and
the
taste
of
my
friends
and
i
may
say
the
taste
of
civilized
and
intelligent
paris
my
activities
were
not
recorded
in
the
papers
i
fancied
they
were
unobserved
i
was
soon
to
be
undeceived
i
wonder
who
the
people
are
that
write
anonymous
letters
and
give
anonymous
tips
to
society
journals
every
once
in
a
while
by
mischance
often
by
my
having
made
a
remark
that
was
misinterpreted
into
something
malicious
or
low
utterly
foreign
to
my
real
meaning
i
have
had
some
fellow
being
suddenly
unveil
a
noisome
corner
in
his
or
her
soul
for
confidently
awaited
sympathy
and
i
have
almost
literally
shrunk
back
in
my
horror
at
the
cesspool
of
coarseness
or
at
the
vicious
envy
have
you
had
that
experience
no
doubt
scattered
among
us
ordinary
folk
neither
particularly
good
nor
particularly
bad
well
rather
than
ill
disposed
and
amiable
if
not
too
severely
tried
or
tempted
no
doubt
scattered
among
us
there
are
not
a
few
of
these
swine
souls
or
snake
souls
hid
beneath
a
pleasant
smile
and
fine
raiment
and
these
are
they
who
give
off
the
foulness
of
the
anonymous
letters
and
the
anonymous
tip
in
one
of
the
minor
london
society
papers
appeared
this
paragraph
which
i
am
sure
i
quote
word
for
word
american
paris
is
much
amused
these
beautifully
fine
spring
days
with
the
ardent
love
making
of
a
recently
divorced
railway
baron
the
lady
is
herself
a
divorcee
of
several
years
standing
and
is
supposed
to
be
engaged
to
a
famous
young
literary
man
who
is
all
unaware
of
what
is
going
on
i
know
of
five
copies
of
this
journal
that
were
mailed
with
the
paragraph
marked
the
five
were
received
by
edna
margot
myself
mary
kirkwood
and
hartley
beechman
i
have
often
mentally
gone
through
the
list
of
my
acquaintances
in
search
of
the
person
who
was
responsible
for
this
thing
i
have
some
extremely
unpleasant
characters
in
that
list
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
suspect
who
did
it
not
improbably
the
guilty
person
is
some
one
in
other
respects
not
a
bad
sort
for
almost
any
given
cut
from
that
vast
universal
human
nature
contains
something
of
everything
i
had
an
engagement
with
mary
kirkwood
to
walk
in
the
bois
and
have
tea
the
afternoon
of
the
day
this
paragraph
reached
me
when
i
arrived
at
her
apartment
she
came
down
ready
to
go
her
costume
was
so
lovely
and
i
so
delighted
in
her
that
i
did
not
immediately
note
the
heavy
circles
round
her
eyes
nor
the
drawn
expression
of
her
mouth
i
did
not
dream
that
she
knew
of
the
paragraph
i
had
read
it
and
had
dismissed
it
from
my
mind
the
anonymous
letter
and
the
anonymous
newspaper
attack
were
old
familiar
stories
to
me
as
they
are
to
every
man
who
attains
distinction
in
active
life
but
as
we
drove
toward
the
bois
i
happened
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
by
way
of
the
mirror
in
the
frame
of
the
taxi
i
saw
the
evidence
of
suffering
and
the
wistful
weary
look
in
her
beautiful
eyes
what
is
it
said
i
you
have
had
bad
news
yes
replied
she
can
i
help
don
t
let
s
talk
of
it
now
said
she
wait
until
we
are
in
the
woods
soon
after
we
passed
the
entrance
gates
we
descended
and
rambled
away
over
the
not
too
even
ground
along
the
indistinct
paths
under
the
fascinating
little
trees
it
was
a
gorgeous
perfumed
may
day
you
know
the
bois
how
lovely
it
is
how
artfully
it
mingles
the
wild
and
the
civilized
suggesting
nature
as
a
laughing
nymph
with
tresses
half
bound
half
free
with
graceful
young
form
half
clad
half
nude
we
rambled
on
and
on
and
after
half
an
hour
seated
ourselves
where
there
were
leaves
and
the
slim
graceful
trunks
on
every
side
and
the
sound
of
falling
water
like
the
musical
voice
of
the
sunbeams
mary
drew
a
long
sigh
i
feel
better
she
said
i
looked
at
her
you
are
better
you
have
shaken
it
off
she
met
my
gaze
this
is
the
last
time
she
said
she
looked
away
repeated
softly
thoughtfully
the
last
time
the
last
time
we
are
not
going
to
see
each
other
any
more
it
is
being
misunderstood
i
glanced
quickly
at
her
and
i
knew
she
had
read
the
paragraph
that
miserable
scandal
sheet
said
i
no
one
sees
it
and
if
they
did
why
should
we
notice
anything
so
ridiculous
she
did
not
answer
immediately
after
a
while
she
said
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
say
it
but
hartley
is
sensitive
a
copy
of
the
paper
got
to
him
one
to
me
one
to
you
one
to
him
no
matter
said
she
the
mischief
is
done
you
do
not
give
up
a
friend
lightly
rejoined
i
the
time
to
speak
was
at
hand
i
welcomed
it
he
has
asked
me
to
give
you
up
said
she
simply
and
i
shall
do
it
but
he
has
no
right
to
ask
such
a
thing
protested
i
yes
he
has
he
and
i
are
engaged
you
knew
that
i
imagined
there
was
some
sort
of
an
engagement
said
i
still
waiting
for
the
right
opening
there
is
only
one
sort
of
engagement
possible
with
me
replied
she
with
a
certain
gentle
reproach
i
know
that
said
i
but
i
remember
the
talk
we
had
on
the
yacht
a
flush
overspread
her
paleness
for
a
moment
then
she
rose
from
the
little
rustic
iron
chair
we
must
go
said
she
wait
said
i
and
i
made
a
tactless
a
stupid
beginning
you
can
t
deny
that
you
do
not
love
him
she
turned
coldly
away
and
walked
on
i
following
i
think
i
ll
not
stop
for
tea
she
said
will
you
hail
the
first
taxi
we
meet
you
are
offended
mary
i
said
what
a
blundering
fool
love
does
make
of
a
man
unless
he
makes
a
fool
of
it
she
shook
her
head
no
not
offended
but
when
a
subject
comes
up
about
which
we
may
not
talk
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
drop
it
in
my
desperation
i
reached
for
the
right
chord
and
struck
it
do
you
know
said
i
why
i
left
the
yacht
abruptly
she
halted
gave
me
a
swift
frightened
glance
the
color
flooded
her
face
then
fled
yes
that
was
why
said
i
and
i
ve
come
as
soon
as
i
could
oh
why
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
cried
she
then
before
i
could
answer
i
don
t
mean
that
i
understand
then
with
a
wild
look
around
what
am
i
saying
i
ve
come
for
you
mary
i
went
on
and
you
are
not
going
to
rush
into
folly
a
second
time
a
greater
folly
for
you
do
not
love
him
and
you
will
care
for
me
you
are
right
we
can
t
discuss
him
you
and
him
but
we
can
and
must
discuss
you
and
me
i
shall
not
see
you
again
said
she
looking
at
me
with
tranquil
eyes
that
would
have
daunted
me
had
i
not
known
her
so
well
understood
her
so
well
which
is
only
another
way
of
saying
had
i
not
loved
her
so
well
why
have
you
been
seeing
me
day
after
day
when
you
knew
that
i
loved
you
i
did
not
know
it
replied
she
i
did
not
think
i
could
move
you
in
the
least
beyond
a
friendly
liking
an
inflection
in
her
voice
made
me
suddenly
realize
you
came
because
it
made
you
happy
to
come
i
cried
triumphantly
i
caught
her
hand
you
do
care
mary
she
drew
her
hand
away
resolutely
i
shall
keep
my
promise
she
said
coldly
i
wish
to
hear
no
more
you
will
not
keep
your
promise
if
necessary
i
ll
go
to
him
and
tell
him
and
he
ll
release
you
she
gave
me
a
look
that
withered
you
do
a
cowardly
thing
like
that
no
said
i
but
you
will
ask
him
to
release
you
you
have
no
right
to
marry
him
and
i
i
love
you
and
must
live
my
life
with
you
or
i
can
think
of
nothing
more
futile
and
empty
than
life
without
you
and
your
life
would
it
not
be
futile
and
empty
mary
if
you
tried
to
live
it
without
me
when
we
might
have
been
together
together
you
and
i
mary
my
love
why
do
you
say
those
things
godfrey
she
cried
passionately
to
make
me
wretched
to
make
it
harder
for
me
to
do
what
i
must
to
make
it
impossible
for
you
to
do
what
you
must
not
marry
a
man
you
don
t
love
marry
him
when
you
love
another
you
d
be
doing
him
the
worst
possible
injury
no
matter
how
much
he
loves
you
he
can
recover
from
the
blow
of
losing
you
but
the
day
to
day
horror
of
such
a
loveless
marriage
would
destroy
you
both
he
is
a
sensitive
man
he
would
feel
it
in
spite
of
all
your
efforts
to
pretend
you
pretend
you
could
not
do
it
after
what
has
passed
between
him
and
me
the
promises
we
ve
exchanged
the
plans
we
ve
made
there
is
no
going
back
i
don
t
wish
to
go
back
i
mary
i
love
you
i
cried
i
love
you
and
you
love
me
that
s
the
wall
between
you
and
any
other
man
between
me
and
any
other
woman
she
had
waved
to
a
passing
taxi
it
swept
into
the
edge
of
the
drive
she
opened
the
door
you
are
not
coming
with
me
she
said
and
i
shall
not
see
you
again
i
laid
my
hand
on
her
arm
and
forced
her
to
meet
my
gaze
you
are
hysterical
now
i
said
but
you
will
be
calm
and
she
gave
me
a
cold
smile
it
would
have
deceived
those
who
do
not
understand
the
temperaments
that
can
conceal
themselves
i
am
perfectly
calm
i
assure
you
said
she
as
you
were
the
first
time
we
ever
met
said
i
you
ve
no
right
to
marry
any
man
but
me
mary
if
you
did
you
d
be
wronging
yourself
me
him
most
of
all
that
is
the
truth
and
you
will
see
it
she
dragged
her
arm
away
burst
into
violent
sobs
sank
upon
the
seat
of
the
cab
i
hesitated
obeyed
a
right
instinct
closed
the
door
gave
her
address
to
the
ignoring
chauffeur
stood
watching
the
cab
whisk
away
i
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
but
i
had
no
fear
for
the
outcome
i
knew
that
i
had
won
that
we
had
won
xi
rossiter
i
believe
i
have
mentioned
the
name
of
my
new
secretary
was
lying
in
wait
for
me
at
the
hotel
entrance
he
read
me
a
telegram
from
margot
edna
was
ill
was
not
expected
to
live
begged
me
to
come
at
once
i
wrote
to
mary
kirkwood
a
brief
repetition
of
what
i
had
said
to
her
of
what
i
know
both
your
intelligence
and
your
heart
are
saying
to
you
dear
i
told
her
that
edna
was
desperately
ill
and
had
sent
for
me
and
that
i
should
be
back
as
soon
as
i
could
get
away
i
went
on
to
say
many
things
such
as
a
man
deeply
in
love
always
says
no
doubt
it
was
a
commonplace
letter
as
sincere
love
letters
are
apt
to
be
but
because
it
was
from
my
heart
i
felt
that
for
all
the
shortcomings
it
would
go
to
her
heart
i
admit
i
am
not
a
facile
love
maker
i
have
had
little
practice
and
i
suspect
those
who
are
facile
at
love
making
have
got
their
facility
by
making
love
speeches
so
often
when
they
were
not
in
earnest
that
they
cannot
but
have
lost
all
capacity
to
be
in
earnest
toward
noon
the
next
day
rossiter
and
i
and
my
valet
were
set
down
at
the
little
station
of
kesson
wells
half
an
hour
out
from
london
in
surrey
we
were
in
the
midst
of
about
as
beautiful
a
country
us
i
have
seen
i
am
a
narrow
enough
patriot
not
to
take
the
most
favorable
view
of
things
foreign
but
i
must
admit
that
no
other
countryside
can
give
one
the
sense
of
sheer
loveliness
that
one
gets
in
certain
parts
of
england
i
am
glad
we
have
nothing
like
it
at
home
for
to
have
it
means
rainy
weather
most
of
the
time
and
serf
labor
and
landlord
selfishly
indifferent
to
the
misery
of
the
poor
human
creatures
he
works
and
robs
still
i
try
to
forget
the
way
it
came
in
the
joy
of
the
thing
itself
as
you
gentle
reader
forget
the
suffering
and
death
of
the
animals
that
make
the
artistic
and
delicious
course
dinners
you
eat
we
were
received
with
much
ceremony
at
the
station
my
money
was
being
exercised
by
those
who
knew
how
to
do
it
after
a
drive
between
perfumed
and
blossoming
hedgerows
and
over
a
road
as
smooth
and
clean
as
a
floor
we
came
to
garton
hall
the
place
my
son
in
law
had
leased
until
his
new
house
should
be
ready
it
was
a
modern
house
as
i
noted
with
relief
when
we
were
still
afar
off
and
while
not
large
was
a
most
satisfactory
embodiment
of
that
often
misused
and
often
misunderstood
word
comfort
to
live
in
the
luxurious
yet
comfortable
comfort
obtainable
in
england
only
indoors
in
its
steam
heated
or
americanized
portions
one
must
have
english
servants
i
am
glad
we
do
not
breed
english
servants
in
america
i
am
glad
that
when
they
are
imported
they
soon
cease
to
be
the
models
of
menial
perfection
they
are
at
home
but
when
i
am
in
england
i
revel
in
the
english
servant
to
find
him
at
his
best
you
must
see
him
serving
in
the
establishment
of
a
great
noble
and
my
son
in
law
was
that
and
the
establishment
over
which
margot
presided
but
with
which
she
was
not
permitted
to
interfere
in
the
smallest
detail
because
of
her
utter
ignorance
of
all
the
vulgarities
of
life
as
became
a
true
lady
of
our
quaint
american
brand
the
establishment
was
a
combination
of
the
best
of
the
city
with
the
best
of
the
country
a
skillful
mingling
of
the
most
attractive
features
of
home
club
and
hotel
my
first
question
at
the
station
had
of
course
been
as
to
mrs
loring
i
was
assured
that
her
ladyship
s
mother
was
somewhat
better
but
still
awaiting
the
dangerous
crisis
of
the
fever
margot
not
a
whit
less
girlish
for
her
maternity
met
me
in
the
doorway
and
had
the
nurse
there
with
the
boy
the
earl
of
gorse
they
said
he
looked
like
me
and
he
did
though
i
do
not
believe
they
thought
so
why
should
they
say
it
i
was
still
a
young
man
and
might
marry
again
i
fancy
the
same
prudent
instinct
prompted
them
to
give
him
godfrey
as
one
of
his
four
or
five
names
why
do
i
think
they
did
not
believe
he
looked
like
me
because
all
of
them
were
ashamed
of
everything
american
in
the
frequent
quarrels
between
margot
and
hugh
he
never
failed
to
use
the
shaft
that
would
surely
pierce
the
heart
of
her
vanity
and
rankle
there
her
low
american
birth
in
such
ghastly
and
grotesque
contrast
to
the
illustrious
descent
of
her
husband
she
had
an
acid
tongue
when
it
came
to
quarreling
she
could
hurl
taunts
about
his
shifts
to
keep
up
appearances
before
he
met
her
that
made
ugly
and
painful
marks
on
his
hide
she
had
discovered
probably
by
gossiping
with
some
traitor
servant
that
he
had
been
flouted
by
a
rich
english
girl
for
a
chauffeur
and
you
may
be
sure
she
put
it
to
good
use
but
nothing
she
could
say
made
him
quiver
as
she
quivered
when
he
opened
out
on
the
subject
of
those
filthy
bounders
in
the
states
do
not
imagine
gentle
reader
that
my
daughter
was
unhappily
married
she
would
not
have
exchanged
places
with
anyone
but
the
wife
of
a
duke
and
hugh
well
he
needed
the
money
nor
should
you
think
that
they
lived
unhappily
together
they
saw
little
of
each
other
alone
and
in
public
they
were
as
smiling
and
amiable
with
each
other
as
perhaps
as
you
and
your
husband
a
fine
baby
was
the
earl
of
gorse
one
who
in
a
decent
environment
would
have
grown
up
a
sensible
useful
person
but
hardly
i
feared
when
he
was
already
living
in
his
own
separate
apartment
with
his
name
the
earl
of
gorse
on
a
card
beside
the
door
and
with
all
the
servants
including
his
mother
treating
him
as
if
he
were
of
superior
clay
this
when
he
barely
had
his
sight
they
say
a
baby
learns
the
utility
of
bawling
at
about
three
days
old
i
should
say
the
germ
of
snobbishness
would
get
to
work
very
soon
thereafter
you
are
waiting
to
hear
what
was
the
matter
with
edna
no
it
was
not
a
fake
illness
to
draw
me
within
reach
for
some
further
trimming
she
had
indeed
fallen
dangerously
ill
did
not
expect
to
live
when
margot
telegraphed
me
it
was
an
intestinal
fever
brought
on
by
the
excesses
of
the
london
season
i
wonder
when
the
biographers
poets
playwrights
novelists
and
other
gentry
who
give
us
the
annals
of
the
race
will
catch
up
with
the
progress
of
science
how
long
will
it
be
before
they
stop
telling
us
of
germ
and
filth
diseases
as
if
they
were
the
romantic
physical
expressions
of
soul
states
there
was
a
time
when
such
blunders
were
excusable
now
science
has
shown
us
that
they
are
so
much
twaddle
so
gentle
reader
i
cannot
gratify
your
taste
for
humbug
and
moonshine
by
telling
you
that
edna
was
stricken
of
remorse
or
of
overjoy
or
of
secret
grief
or
of
any
other
soul
state
whatever
the
doctor
bosh
was
of
course
nervous
exhaustion
it
always
is
if
the
patient
is
above
the
working
class
the
truth
was
that
she
fell
ill
even
as
you
and
i
she
ate
and
drank
too
much
both
at
and
between
meals
and
did
not
take
proper
care
of
herself
in
any
way
she
wore
dresses
that
were
nearly
nothing
in
cold
carriages
and
draughty
rooms
when
she
was
laden
with
undigested
food
vulgar
isn
t
it
revolting
for
me
to
speak
thus
of
a
lady
but
i
am
trying
to
tell
the
truth
gentle
reader
not
to
increase
your
stock
of
slop
and
lies
which
you
call
culture
and
if
a
lady
will
put
herself
in
such
a
condition
why
should
it
not
be
spoken
of
why
go
on
lying
about
these
things
and
encouraging
people
to
attribute
to
sensitive
nerves
and
souls
the
consequences
of
gluttony
ignorance
and
neglect
i
am
not
criticising
edna
for
getting
into
such
an
internal
physical
state
that
a
pestilence
began
to
rage
within
her
the
most
intelligent
of
us
is
only
too
foolish
and
ignorant
in
these
matters
thanks
to
stupid
education
from
childhood
up
and
she
has
the
added
excuse
of
having
been
exposed
to
the
temptations
of
a
london
season
she
fell
it
is
hardly
in
human
nature
not
to
fall
you
have
been
through
a
london
season
it
is
a
mad
chase
from
food
to
food
you
rise
and
hastily
swallow
a
heavy
english
breakfast
you
ride
in
the
row
a
while
ride
toward
a
lunch
table
and
an
english
lunch
especially
in
the
season
means
a
bigger
dinner
than
any
frenchman
or
other
highly
civilized
person
ever
willingly
sat
down
to
hardly
is
this
long
lunch
over
before
it
is
time
for
tea
which
means
not
merely
tea
but
toast
and
sandwiches
and
hot
muffins
and
many
kinds
of
heavy
cake
and
often
fruit
or
jam
tea
is
to
give
you
an
appetite
for
the
dinner
that
follows
and
what
a
dinner
one
rich
heavy
course
upon
another
with
drenchings
of
wine
and
a
poisonous
liqueur
afterward
you
sit
about
until
this
has
settled
a
bit
then
on
to
supper
not
so
formidable
a
meal
as
the
dinner
but
still
what
any
reasonable
person
would
call
a
square
meal
then
to
bed
by
no
means
on
to
a
ball
where
you
eat
and
drink
in
desultory
fashion
until
late
supper
is
served
you
roll
heavily
home
to
sleep
but
hardly
have
your
eyes
closed
when
you
are
roused
to
eat
again
it
is
breakfast
time
and
another
day
of
stuffing
has
begun
starvation
they
tell
me
is
one
of
the
regular
causes
of
death
in
london
but
that
is
in
the
east
end
in
the
west
end
and
you
gentle
reader
are
interested
only
in
that
section
death
i
ll
wager
reaps
twenty
from
overfeeding
to
one
he
gets
in
the
east
end
through
underfeeding
famine
is
a
dreadful
thing
but
how
characteristic
of
the
shallowness
of
human
beings
it
is
that
you
can
make
a
poetic
horror
out
of
famine
when
no
one
would
listen
while
you
told
the
far
more
horrible
truth
of
the
frightful
ravages
of
overfeeding
chief
cause
of
all
the
diseases
that
torture
and
twist
the
human
body
aging
and
killing
it
prematurely
edna
had
been
for
many
years
most
cautiously
careful
of
her
health
she
loved
her
youth
her
beautiful
body
she
fought
against
her
natural
fondness
for
food
and
wine
i
fancy
that
for
this
first
season
after
freedom
she
relaxed
her
rules
and
turned
herself
loose
to
celebrate
i
know
she
must
have
had
something
of
this
sort
in
mind
because
her
french
maid
i
could
not
talk
with
the
italian
told
me
that
madame
had
arranged
an
elaborate
programme
of
cures
on
the
continent
after
the
season
and
they
were
to
be
serious
cures
said
she
her
illness
took
such
a
course
of
ups
and
downs
with
death
always
hovering
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
leave
i
wrote
mary
i
got
no
reply
i
sent
rossiter
to
paris
he
reported
that
mrs
armstrong
and
mrs
kirkwood
had
left
for
the
country
but
that
he
could
get
no
address
you
probably
picture
me
as
scarcely
able
to
restrain
myself
from
acting
like
a
madman
how
little
you
know
of
me
do
you
think
i
could
have
achieved
my
solid
success
before
i
reached
forty
five
years
if
i
had
been
one
of
the
little
people
who
fret
and
fume
against
the
inevitable
all
men
who
amount
to
anything
are
violent
men
jesus
the
model
of
serenity
and
patience
scourged
the
money
changers
from
the
temple
washington
one
more
great
exemplar
of
the
majesty
of
repose
swore
like
a
lunatic
at
the
battle
of
monmouth
these
great
ones
simply
had
in
the
highest
form
the
virtues
that
make
for
success
in
every
department
of
leadership
certainly
i
am
a
violent
man
but
i
have
rarely
been
foolish
enough
to
go
crazy
to
no
purpose
what
could
i
do
but
wait
and
over
that
beautiful
quiet
country
place
floated
the
black
cormorant
with
wings
outspread
and
hollow
burning
eyes
bent
eagerly
downward
i
waited
not
in
fury
but
oppressed
by
a
deep
melancholy
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
thinking
seriously
of
death
to
any
man
no
decisive
event
of
life
is
so
absolutely
unimportant
as
his
own
death
i
never
have
wasted
and
never
shall
waste
a
moment
in
thinking
of
my
death
it
may
concern
others
but
how
does
it
concern
me
when
it
comes
i
shall
not
be
there
the
death
of
another
however
that
is
cause
for
reflection
for
sadness
i
knew
as
did
no
one
else
how
intensely
edna
loved
life
how
in
her
own
way
of
strain
and
struggle
she
enjoyed
it
and
to
me
it
was
pitiful
this
spectacle
of
her
sudden
arrest
her
sudden
mortal
peril
as
she
was
about
to
achieve
the
summit
of
her
ambition
i
wondered
as
to
frascatoni
i
pictured
him
waiting
with
those
tranquil
weary
eyes
already
looking
about
for
another
means
to
his
aim
of
large
fortune
should
this
means
fail
there
i
misjudged
him
for
one
day
as
i
stood
in
a
balcony
overlooking
the
drive
he
came
rushing
up
in
a
motor
and
my
first
glance
at
his
haggard
face
told
me
that
he
loved
her
in
a
way
it
is
small
compliment
to
a
woman
to
be
loved
by
the
fortune
hunting
sort
of
man
for
he
does
not
release
himself
until
he
has
the
permit
of
basest
self
interest
but
frascatoni
having
released
himself
had
fallen
in
love
with
all
the
frenzy
of
his
super
refined
passionately
imaginative
nature
after
a
few
minutes
he
drove
away
i
do
not
know
what
occurred
naturally
they
would
not
speak
of
his
call
and
i
did
not
ask
questions
i
can
imagine
however
she
seemed
better
that
day
and
he
must
have
gone
away
reassured
he
was
sending
every
morning
enormous
quantities
of
flowers
such
skill
and
taste
showed
in
the
arranging
that
i
am
sure
it
was
not
the
usual
meaningless
performance
of
rich
people
who
are
always
trying
to
make
money
spending
serve
instead
of
thoughtful
and
delicate
attention
nearly
a
month
dragged
along
before
she
was
able
to
see
me
as
i
have
explained
her
beauty
was
not
dependent
upon
evanescent
charms
of
contour
and
coloring
but
was
securely
founded
in
the
structure
of
her
head
and
face
and
body
so
i
saw
lying
weakly
in
the
bed
an
emaciated
but
lovely
edna
instantly
on
sight
of
her
there
came
flooding
back
to
me
the
memory
of
the
birth
of
margot
our
first
child
how
edna
had
looked
when
they
let
me
go
into
the
humble
almost
squalid
little
bedroom
in
the
flat
of
which
we
were
so
vain
she
was
looking
exactly
so
in
this
bed
of
state
in
this
magnificent
room
with
the
evidences
of
wealth
and
rank
and
fashion
on
every
side
she
smiled
faintly
one
of
the
slim
weak
hands
lying
upon
the
cream
white
silk
coverlet
moved
i
bent
and
kissed
it
thank
you
for
being
here
she
murmured
tears
in
her
eyes
her
lips
could
scarcely
utter
the
words
you
must
not
speak
your
ladyship
warned
the
nurse
to
flatter
americans
and
to
give
themselves
the
comfortable
feeling
of
gratified
snobbishness
english
servants
address
us
or
rather
our
women
as
if
we
had
titles
you
are
to
get
well
rapidly
now
i
said
you
ll
stay
until
i
can
talk
to
you
yes
i
said
what
else
could
i
say
they
motioned
me
away
i
had
committed
myself
to
several
weeks
more
of
that
futile
monotony
and
i
no
longer
had
the
restraint
of
the
sense
that
she
might
die
at
any
moment
even
had
i
been
willing
to
break
my
promise
i
could
not
have
done
so
for
she
would
have
me
in
every
morning
and
every
afternoon
to
look
at
me
and
they
told
me
that
if
i
were
not
there
to
reassure
her
it
would
undoubtedly
cause
a
change
for
the
worse
i
stayed
on
and
wrote
to
mary
kirkwood
all
the
time
with
the
fear
that
my
letters
were
not
reaching
her
but
also
with
the
unshakable
conviction
that
she
was
mine
you
smile
at
this
as
proof
of
my
colossal
vanity
well
your
smile
convicts
you
of
never
having
loved
the
essence
of
love
is
congeniality
appetite
is
the
essence
of
passion
which
therefore
has
no
sense
of
or
especial
desire
for
mutuality
passion
is
as
common
as
any
other
physical
appetite
love
is
as
rare
as
are
souls
generous
enough
to
experience
or
to
inspire
it
the
essence
of
love
is
congeniality
and
i
knew
there
was
a
sympathy
and
understanding
between
me
and
mary
kirkwood
that
made
us
lovers
for
all
time
there
came
a
day
how
it
burned
into
my
memory
when
edna
was
well
enough
to
talk
with
me
several
days
before
and
i
saw
that
it
was
not
far
away
and
i
awaited
it
with
fierce
impatience
she
would
tell
me
why
she
had
sent
for
me
and
i
should
be
free
to
go
it
was
one
of
those
soft
gray
days
of
alternating
rain
and
sun
that
are
the
specialty
of
the
british
climate
edna
with
flowers
everywhere
in
her
sitting
room
was
half
reclining
in
an
invalid
chair
all
manner
of
rich
delicate
silk
and
lace
assistants
to
comfort
luxury
and
beauty
adorning
her
or
forming
background
for
her
lovely
face
and
head
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
detail
of
the
room
or
of
her
appearance
that
i
could
not
reproduce
though
at
the
time
i
was
unaware
of
anything
but
her
voice
her
words
i
entered
seated
myself
in
the
broad
low
window
opposite
her
she
looked
at
me
a
long
time
a
strange
soft
expression
in
her
weary
eyes
an
expression
that
disquieted
me
at
last
she
said
it
is
so
good
to
be
getting
well
and
you
are
getting
well
rapidly
i
said
you
have
a
wonderful
constitution
you
are
glad
i
am
better
godfrey
i
laughed
what
a
foolish
question
i
didn
t
know
said
she
i
feared
i
have
acted
so
badly
toward
you
no
indeed
replied
i
don
t
worry
about
those
things
i
hope
you
feel
as
friendly
toward
me
as
i
do
toward
you
but
you
have
always
been
good
to
me
even
when
i
haven
t
deserved
it
this
was
most
puzzling
said
i
vaguely
i
guess
we
ve
both
done
the
best
we
could
do
you
want
to
tell
me
to
day
why
you
sent
for
me
or
don
t
you
feel
strong
enough
yes
i
wish
to
tell
you
to
day
but
it
isn
t
easy
to
say
i
m
very
proud
godfrey
and
when
i
ve
been
in
the
wrong
it
s
hard
for
me
to
admit
oh
come
now
edna
said
i
soothingly
let
s
not
rake
up
the
past
it
s
finished
and
it
has
left
no
hard
feeling
at
least
not
in
me
don
t
think
of
anything
but
of
getting
well
she
lay
gazing
out
into
the
gentle
rain
with
the
sunshine
glistening
upon
it
a
few
large
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
there
s
nothing
to
be
unhappy
about
said
i
you
are
far
on
the
way
to
health
you
are
as
lovely
as
ever
and
you
will
get
everything
you
want
oh
it
s
so
hard
to
tell
you
she
sighed
then
don
t
i
urged
if
there
s
anything
i
can
do
for
you
let
me
know
i
ll
be
glad
to
do
it
she
covered
her
eyes
with
her
thin
beautiful
hand
love
me
love
me
godfrey
as
you
used
to
she
sobbed
i
was
dumbfounded
it
seemed
to
me
i
could
not
have
heard
aright
i
stared
at
her
until
she
lowered
her
hand
and
looked
at
me
then
i
hastily
glanced
away
i
m
sorry
for
the
way
i
ve
acted
she
went
on
i
want
you
to
take
me
back
that
was
why
i
sent
for
you
i
puzzled
over
this
was
she
still
out
of
her
mind
or
was
there
some
other
and
sane
and
extremely
practical
reason
behind
this
strange
turn
for
i
could
not
for
an
instant
imagine
she
was
in
sane
and
sober
earnest
you
don
t
believe
me
she
cried
no
wonder
but
it
s
so
godfrey
i
want
your
love
i
want
you
won
t
you
won
t
you
take
me
back
her
voice
sounded
pitifully
sick
and
weak
and
when
i
looked
at
her
i
could
not
but
see
that
to
refuse
to
humor
her
would
be
to
endanger
her
life
i
said
edna
this
is
an
utter
surprise
for
me
about
the
last
thing
i
expected
i
can
t
grasp
it
so
suddenly
i
i
do
you
really
mean
it
i
really
mean
it
dear
she
said
earnestly
it
was
evident
she
in
her
secret
heart
was
taking
it
for
granted
that
her
news
would
be
welcome
to
me
that
all
she
had
to
do
in
order
to
win
me
back
as
her
devoted
enslaved
husband
was
to
announce
her
willingness
to
come
i
have
often
marveled
at
this
peculiar
vanity
of
women
their
deep
abiding
belief
in
the
power
of
their
own
charms
the
all
but
impossibility
of
a
man
s
ever
convincing
a
woman
that
he
does
not
love
her
they
say
hope
is
the
hardiest
of
human
emotions
i
doubt
it
i
think
vanity
especially
the
sex
vanity
both
of
men
and
of
women
is
far
and
away
hardier
than
even
hope
i
saw
she
was
assuming
i
would
be
delighted
deeply
grateful
ardently
responsive
as
soon
as
i
should
grasp
the
dazzling
glad
tidings
and
she
so
ill
and
weak
that
i
dared
not
speak
at
all
frankly
to
her
she
stretched
out
her
hand
for
mine
i
slowly
took
it
held
it
listlessly
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
what
to
say
it
is
so
good
to
have
you
again
dear
she
murmured
aren
t
you
going
to
kiss
me
i
don
t
understand
i
muttered
dropping
her
hand
and
standing
up
to
gaze
out
over
the
gardens
i
am
stunned
i
ve
been
cruel
to
you
she
said
with
gracious
humility
can
you
ever
forgive
me
there
s
nothing
to
forgive
but
there
i
halted
i
ll
make
up
for
it
dear
she
went
on
sweetly
gracious
i
m
not
surprised
that
you
are
stunned
you
didn
t
realize
how
i
loved
you
i
didn
t
myself
i
couldn
t
believe
at
first
when
i
found
out
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
talk
about
these
things
to
day
said
i
we
ll
wait
until
she
interrupted
my
hesitating
speech
with
a
laugh
full
of
gentle
gayety
you
re
quite
wrong
said
she
i
m
not
out
of
my
mind
i
mean
it
dear
and
more
oh
we
shall
be
so
happy
you
ve
been
far
too
modest
about
yourself
you
don
t
appreciate
what
a
fascinating
man
you
are
i
m
sure
i
reddened
violently
i
sat
rose
sat
again
you
ve
given
me
the
shock
of
my
life
said
i
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
i
ll
have
to
think
this
over
i
rose
no
don
t
go
yet
said
she
with
the
graciousness
of
a
princess
granting
a
longer
interview
let
me
tell
you
all
about
it
not
to
day
i
pleaded
you
must
be
careful
you
mustn
t
overtax
yourself
oh
but
this
does
me
good
sit
near
me
godfrey
and
hold
my
hand
while
i
tell
you
i
felt
like
one
closeted
with
an
insane
person
and
compelled
to
humor
his
caprices
i
obediently
shifted
to
a
seat
near
her
and
took
her
hand
you
could
never
guess
how
it
came
about
she
went
on
as
she
was
looking
inquiringly
at
me
i
said
no
it
was
very
strange
for
the
first
few
weeks
after
the
divorce
no
not
the
divorce
but
the
decree
for
it
isn
t
a
divorce
yet
thank
god
for
the
first
weeks
i
was
happy
or
thought
i
was
i
went
early
and
late
i
had
never
been
so
gay
i
acted
like
a
girl
just
launched
in
society
i
was
in
ecstasies
over
my
freedom
do
you
mind
dear
does
it
hurt
you
for
me
to
say
these
things
no
no
said
i
go
on
how
queer
you
are
but
i
suppose
you
are
dazed
poor
dear
never
mind
when
i
am
better
stronger
i
ll
soon
convince
you
and
she
nodded
and
smiled
at
me
poor
dear
how
cruel
i
have
been
yes
we
ll
wait
till
you
are
stronger
stammered
i
making
a
move
to
rise
but
i
must
tell
you
how
it
came
about
she
said
detaining
me
all
of
a
sudden
when
i
was
at
my
gayest
i
began
to
feel
strange
and
sad
to
dislike
everyone
and
everything
about
me
it
was
the
illness
working
in
you
said
i
she
gave
the
smile
of
gentle
tolerance
with
which
she
received
my
attempts
at
humor
when
she
was
in
an
amiable
mood
how
like
you
that
is
but
it
wasn
t
the
illness
at
all
it
was
my
inmost
heart
striving
to
force
open
its
door
and
reveal
its
secret
do
be
a
little
romantic
this
once
dear
well
and
then
then
a
paragraph
in
one
of
the
society
papers
some
one
sent
it
to
me
anonymously
was
it
you
dear
and
did
you
do
it
to
make
me
jealous
she
spoke
as
one
who
suddenly
sees
straight
into
a
secret
i
didn
t
said
i
hastily
it
never
entered
my
head
to
think
you
cared
a
rap
about
me
now
don
t
tease
me
godfrey
dear
you
must
have
been
making
all
sorts
of
plans
to
win
me
back
you
read
the
item
in
the
paper
suggested
i
oh
yes
i
must
finish
i
read
it
and
at
first
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
said
to
myself
i
didn
t
in
the
least
care
but
i
couldn
t
get
the
thing
out
of
mind
godfrey
i
had
always
been
too
sure
of
you
you
never
seemed
to
be
a
single
tiny
bit
interested
in
other
women
so
the
thought
of
you
and
another
woman
had
not
once
come
to
me
that
item
put
it
there
you
my
husband
my
godfrey
and
another
woman
it
was
like
touching
a
match
to
powder
i
went
mad
i
she
was
sitting
up
her
eyes
wild
her
voice
trembling
you
must
not
excite
yourself
edna
i
said
i
went
mad
she
repeated
so
interested
in
her
emotions
that
she
probably
did
not
hear
me
i
rushed
down
to
margot
i
fell
ill
i
made
her
telegraph
for
you
oh
how
i
suffered
until
i
knew
you
were
here
if
you
hadn
t
come
right
away
i
d
have
cabled
to
my
lawyer
in
new
york
to
have
the
divorce
set
aside
or
whatever
they
do
i
can
have
it
set
aside
any
time
up
to
the
end
of
the
six
months
can
t
i
yes
admitted
i
though
her
tone
of
positive
knowledge
made
my
reply
superfluous
she
seemed
instinctively
to
feel
a
suspicion
an
explanation
of
her
amazing
about
face
that
was
slowly
gathering
in
my
bewildered
mind
she
drew
from
the
folds
of
her
negligee
a
note
and
handed
it
to
me
she
said
i
haven
t
confessed
the
worst
i
had
done
read
that
never
mind
said
i
i
don
t
wish
to
know
but
i
wish
you
to
know
insisted
she
there
mustn
t
be
anything
dark
between
us
i
reluctantly
opened
the
note
and
read
it
was
from
prince
frascatoni
not
the
cold
bid
for
a
break
that
my
suspicion
expected
but
a
passionate
appeal
to
her
not
to
break
their
engagement
and
throw
him
over
i
could
by
no
reach
of
the
imagination
picture
that
calm
weary
eyed
man
of
the
world
writing
those
lines
which
shows
how
ill
men
understand
each
other
where
women
are
concerned
he
sent
me
that
note
the
day
i
came
here
said
she
i
did
not
answer
it
her
tone
was
supreme
indifference
the
peculiar
cruelty
of
woman
toward
man
when
she
does
not
care
you
were
engaged
to
him
said
i
because
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
yes
said
she
then
with
the
chaste
pride
of
the
good
woman
but
not
until
after
the
decree
was
granted
he
would
have
declared
himself
in
new
york
but
i
wouldn
t
permit
that
at
least
godfrey
i
never
forgot
with
other
men
that
i
was
your
wife
or
let
them
forget
it
you
believe
me
i
m
sure
of
it
said
i
she
gazed
dreamily
into
vacancy
to
think
she
mused
that
i
imagined
i
could
marry
him
any
man
how
little
a
woman
knows
her
own
heart
i
always
loved
you
godfrey
i
don
t
believe
there
is
any
such
thing
as
divorce
not
for
a
good
woman
when
she
gives
herself
in
a
dreamy
musical
voice
with
a
tender
pressure
of
my
hand
it
is
for
time
and
for
eternity
never
in
all
my
life
had
i
so
welcomed
anyone
as
i
welcomed
the
interrupting
nurse
i
felt
during
the
whole
interview
that
i
was
under
a
strain
until
i
was
in
the
open
air
and
alone
i
did
not
realize
how
terrific
the
strain
i
walked
on
and
on
like
a
madman
vaulting
gates
and
fences
scrambling
over
hedges
plowing
through
gardens
leaping
brooks
on
and
on
hour
after
hour
what
should
i
do
what
could
i
do
nothing
but
wait
until
she
was
out
of
danger
wait
and
study
away
at
this
incredible
impossible
freak
of
hers
try
to
fathom
it
if
it
was
not
the
vagary
of
a
diseased
mind
i
wished
to
believe
it
that
but
i
could
not
there
was
nothing
of
insanity
in
her
manner
and
from
beginning
to
end
her
story
was
coherent
and
plausible
plausible
but
not
believable
for
i
had
no
more
vanity
about
her
loving
me
than
has
the
next
man
when
he
does
not
want
the
love
offered
him
and
finds
it
inconvenient
to
credit
and
so
is
in
the
frame
of
mind
to
see
calmly
and
clearly
i
wandered
so
far
that
i
had
to
hire
a
conveyance
at
some
village
at
which
i
halted
toward
nightfall
as
soon
as
i
was
at
the
house
i
ordered
my
valet
to
pack
and
wrote
edna
a
note
saying
that
neglected
business
compelled
me
to
bolt
for
london
but
i
ll
be
back
i
wrote
at
the
command
of
human
decency
i
feel
that
i
can
go
as
you
are
almost
well
half
an
hour
later
i
was
in
the
train
for
london
a
letter
feebly
scrawled
came
from
her
the
next
day
but
one
a
brief
loving
note
saying
that
she
understood
and
that
i
knew
how
eagerly
she
was
looking
forward
to
my
return
but
don
t
worry
dearest
about
me
i
shall
soon
be
well
now
that
my
conscience
is
clear
and
all
is
peace
and
love
between
us
i
know
how
you
hate
to
write
letters
but
you
will
telegraph
me
every
day
how
i
got
through
those
next
few
weeks
i
cannot
tell
i
had
no
sense
of
the
reality
of
the
world
about
me
or
of
my
own
thoughts
and
actions
every
once
in
a
while
sometimes
when
i
was
talking
with
the
men
whose
company
i
sought
again
when
i
was
alone
in
bed
and
would
start
abruptly
from
sleep
i
pinched
myself
or
struck
myself
violently
to
see
if
i
was
awake
edna
s
letters
were
daily
and
long
i
read
them
stared
at
them
felt
less
certain
than
ever
of
my
sanity
or
of
my
being
awake
i
sent
her
an
occasional
telegram
dictated
to
rossiter
a
vague
sentence
of
congratulation
on
her
better
health
or
something
of
that
kind
soon
this
formality
degenerated
to
a
request
to
rossiter
and
telegraph
mrs
loring
or
he
would
say
shall
i
send
mrs
loring
a
telegram
and
i
would
reply
yes
do
please
it
was
obviously
necessary
that
i
should
not
see
her
before
she
was
well
enough
to
be
talked
to
frankly
i
invented
excuses
for
staying
away
until
my
ability
in
that
direction
gave
out
then
rossiter
best
of
secretaries
divining
my
plight
came
to
the
rescue
i
gave
him
a
free
hand
he
went
too
far
created
in
her
predisposed
mind
the
illusion
that
i
was
champing
with
impatience
at
the
business
that
persisted
in
keeping
me
away
from
her
i
do
not
blame
him
he
took
the
only
possible
course
at
last
she
was
completely
restored
the
doctors
and
nurses
could
find
no
pretext
for
lingering
and
that
in
itself
was
proof
positive
of
her
health
and
strength
she
was
having
her
meals
with
the
family
was
attending
to
her
correspondence
was
alarmed
because
she
was
taking
on
flesh
so
rapidly
she
began
offering
to
join
me
in
london
when
she
wrote
that
she
was
starting
the
next
day
i
telegraphed
her
not
to
come
and
after
four
more
days
of
delay
on
various
excuses
i
went
down
i
should
have
liked
to
postpone
this
interview
a
week
or
ten
days
again
i
see
you
smiling
at
me
posing
as
madly
in
love
with
mary
kirkwood
yet
able
to
put
off
the
joy
of
being
free
to
go
to
her
but
gentle
reader
you
must
not
forget
that
i
had
first
to
deal
with
edna
and
from
what
you
have
learned
of
her
do
you
think
i
was
wise
or
foolish
to
wish
to
meet
her
only
when
she
could
not
possibly
prevent
candor
by
pleading
a
remnant
of
invalidism
she
was
charmingly
dressed
to
receive
me
rushed
forward
before
them
all
and
flung
her
arms
around
my
neck
in
a
graceful
effusive
fashion
she
had
learned
on
the
continent
i
received
the
shock
as
calmly
as
i
could
noting
the
awkwardly
concealed
surprise
of
margot
and
hugh
we
had
lunch
she
did
most
of
the
talking
a
gay
happy
hearted
rattling
the
natural
expression
of
a
woman
with
not
a
care
in
the
world
and
i
in
spite
of
myself
i
felt
like
an
executioner
come
to
assassinate
an
unsuspicious
and
innocent
victim
for
the
best
side
of
her
was
to
the
fore
and
all
the
unpleasant
traits
were
so
thoroughly
concealed
that
they
seemed
to
have
been
burned
up
in
that
terrible
fever
i
knew
they
were
still
there
but
i
could
not
feel
it
when
we
were
alone
in
her
sitting
room
she
said
where
s
your
valet
and
your
luggage
in
london
said
i
oh
they
re
coming
on
a
later
train
no
said
i
seizing
this
excellent
opportunity
i
m
going
back
this
afternoon
she
gave
a
cry
of
dismay
godfrey
she
exclaimed
isn
t
it
a
shame
then
rushing
to
the
bell
i
ll
have
my
things
got
ready
i
ll
go
back
with
you
you
shan
t
be
left
alone
dearest
i
seated
myself
don
t
ring
i
said
wait
till
we
ve
talked
the
matter
over
i
see
you
can
t
really
believe
even
yet
cried
she
laughingly
i
must
convince
you
and
she
rang
the
bell
when
your
maid
comes
send
her
away
said
i
don
t
order
her
to
pack
you
can
t
go
with
me
she
looked
at
me
anxiously
how
solemn
you
are
she
cried
has
something
gone
wrong
in
that
business
nothing
said
i
the
maid
came
was
sent
away
edna
moved
toward
me
would
have
sat
in
my
lap
or
on
the
arm
of
my
chair
had
i
not
prevented
her
by
rising
on
the
pretext
of
lighting
a
cigarette
you
are
very
very
strange
said
she
then
advancing
toward
me
and
gazing
into
my
face
godfrey
there
wasn
t
any
truth
in
that
item
was
there
she
looked
like
a
sweet
lovely
slip
of
a
girl
all
tenderness
and
sincerity
i
ve
come
to
discuss
our
affairs
not
malicious
newspaper
gossip
said
i
fighting
for
my
usual
manner
of
good
humored
raillery
first
tell
me
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
outburst
of
affection
for
me
aren
t
you
satisfied
with
the
settlements
oh
godfrey
what
a
cynic
you
are
laughed
she
then
with
an
air
of
earnestness
that
certainly
was
convincing
she
said
can
t
you
feel
that
i
love
you
i
cannot
replied
i
blandly
on
the
contrary
i
know
that
you
care
nothing
about
me
so
let
s
talk
business
as
we
always
have
she
did
not
rave
and
vow
and
swear
she
did
not
show
the
least
excitement
she
seated
herself
and
fixing
upon
me
a
look
which
i
can
only
describe
as
tenacious
she
said
whether
you
believe
me
or
not
i
love
you
and
i
shall
not
give
you
up
my
internal
agitation
instantly
cleared
away
i
am
always
nervous
about
crossing
a
bridge
until
my
foot
touches
it
thenceforth
i
am
too
busy
crossing
to
bother
about
myself
well
what
do
you
propose
said
i
to
be
your
wife
replied
she
to
show
you
how
sorry
i
am
for
the
way
i
have
acted
to
show
you
by
thinking
only
of
making
you
happy
yes
and
what
will
you
do
to
make
me
happy
look
after
your
comfort
your
home
godfrey
but
you
don
t
know
about
that
sort
of
thing
said
i
you
know
only
how
to
make
a
house
attractive
to
other
people
you
are
far
too
fine
for
a
private
housekeeper
i
shall
learn
said
she
sweetly
those
things
are
not
difficult
i
smiled
at
this
unconscious
confession
of
incapacity
to
learn
the
most
difficult
of
all
the
arts
you
will
practice
on
me
eh
thank
you
but
no
you
wouldn
t
make
me
comfortable
you
d
only
harass
yourself
and
deprive
me
of
comfort
and
for
years
those
things
are
less
easy
than
you
imagine
you
are
set
in
your
ways
i
in
mine
you
don
t
realize
protested
she
confidently
you
must
be
lonely
godfrey
you
need
companionship
sympathy
i
can
give
it
to
you
now
for
i
am
awake
at
last
i
know
my
own
mind
and
heart
i
shook
my
head
that
sounds
well
but
what
does
it
mean
next
door
to
nothing
my
friend
you
and
i
are
not
interested
in
the
same
things
we
ve
nothing
to
talk
about
i
don
t
know
the
things
you
know
the
social
the
fashionable
side
of
life
you
don
t
know
my
side
of
life
and
you
couldn
t
and
wouldn
t
learn
enough
to
interest
me
any
forced
interest
you
might
give
would
bore
me
pardon
my
frankness
but
this
is
no
time
for
polite
falsehoods
the
fact
is
we
ve
outgrown
each
other
when
we
look
out
of
our
eyes
each
of
us
sees
an
entirely
different
world
and
neither
of
us
cares
about
or
even
believes
in
the
other
s
world
we
talk
only
to
irritate
we
are
absolutely
and
finally
apart
it
would
be
impossible
for
us
to
live
together
she
waited
until
i
finished
i
doubt
if
she
listened
it
was
her
habit
not
to
listen
to
what
she
did
not
wish
to
hear
godfrey
godfrey
she
cried
battling
with
the
sobs
that
rose
perhaps
in
spite
of
her
do
i
mean
nothing
to
you
i
who
have
been
everything
to
you
does
the
word
wife
mean
nothing
to
you
you
mean
nothing
to
me
replied
i
and
i
mean
nothing
to
you
let
us
not
pretend
to
deceive
ourselves
but
you
did
care
about
me
once
she
pleaded
i
am
not
old
and
faded
i
still
have
all
the
charms
i
used
to
have
yes
and
more
isn
t
that
so
dear
you
are
more
beautiful
than
you
ever
were
said
i
but
you
ve
gotten
me
out
of
the
habit
of
you
and
i
couldn
t
go
back
to
it
if
i
would
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
wept
at
your
old
tricks
said
i
impatiently
it
has
always
been
your
way
to
try
to
make
me
seem
in
the
wrong
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
lost
years
ago
lost
before
i
did
all
interest
and
taste
for
our
life
together
it
was
you
who
ended
our
married
life
not
i
yes
it
was
all
my
fault
she
sobbed
forgive
me
dear
take
me
back
don
t
cast
me
off
i
ll
be
whatever
you
say
do
whatever
you
wish
only
take
me
back
i
could
not
make
an
inch
of
progress
toward
the
real
motive
behind
this
obviously
sincere
plea
as
i
sat
silent
looking
at
her
and
puzzling
she
began
to
hope
that
she
had
moved
me
no
rather
she
began
to
feel
stronger
in
her
deep
rooted
conviction
that
at
bottom
i
loved
her
and
had
never
wavered
she
came
across
the
room
dropped
to
her
knees
beside
my
chair
and
hid
her
face
in
my
lap
why
is
it
that
passion
once
extinguished
can
never
light
again
as
she
knelt
there
i
appreciated
all
her
physical
charms
but
i
was
appreciative
with
that
critical
calmness
which
is
the
absence
of
all
feeling
i
laid
my
hand
on
hers
edna
i
said
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
godfrey
replied
she
lifting
her
gold
brown
eyes
to
gaze
at
me
as
god
is
my
judge
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
no
doubt
you
think
you
are
said
i
diplomatically
but
your
good
sense
must
tell
you
that
there
s
something
wrong
yes
with
you
was
her
answer
in
a
sad
tone
i
hoped
we
could
begin
to
be
happy
at
once
i
see
now
that
i
ve
got
to
win
you
back
i
concealed
my
panic
behind
an
amused
laugh
i
suppose
i
ve
misled
you
into
forming
this
poor
estimate
of
my
intelligence
where
you
are
concerned
said
i
you
have
thought
all
these
years
that
because
i
said
nothing
i
did
not
understand
the
truth
is
for
many
years
i
have
understood
you
thoroughly
edna
you
doubt
it
you
say
to
yourself
if
he
had
understood
he
would
have
been
furious
and
would
not
have
allowed
me
to
use
him
as
a
mere
pocketbook
up
she
started
wounded
to
the
quick
godfrey
she
cried
how
you
hurt
oh
my
dear
spare
me
if
you
had
such
a
low
opinion
of
me
don
t
tell
me
about
it
perhaps
i
deserve
your
contempt
god
knows
i
thought
i
was
doing
right
don
t
be
harsh
with
me
dearest
i
am
only
a
woman
after
all
i
shook
my
head
smilingly
drop
it
said
i
you
are
entirely
too
strong
a
person
to
be
able
to
hide
behind
a
plea
of
weakness
i
have
let
you
use
me
for
your
own
selfish
pleasure
all
these
years
because
i
did
not
especially
care
also
it
kept
you
away
from
me
which
was
highly
agreeable
to
us
both
the
anguish
in
her
eyes
whether
it
was
genuine
or
not
looked
so
sincere
that
i
avoided
her
gaze
but
i
went
on
i
m
no
longer
in
the
mood
to
be
used
you
got
through
with
me
as
you
thought
and
divorced
me
and
prepared
to
marry
a
man
more
to
your
liking
godfrey
you
needn
t
be
jealous
of
him
of
anyone
i
made
a
gesture
of
resigned
despair
jealous
her
vanity
rampant
it
had
seized
upon
an
insignificant
phrase
and
had
found
what
it
was
eagerly
looking
for
i
am
not
jealous
of
him
said
i
though
it
would
be
useless
for
me
to
try
to
convince
you
still
i
repeat
i
am
not
jealous
i
was
merely
saying
that
you
have
cast
me
off
that
i
choose
to
regard
your
action
as
final
that
i
shall
not
let
you
fasten
on
me
again
simply
because
your
selfishness
and
vanity
happen
to
discover
a
new
value
in
me
do
i
make
my
position
clear
i
see
i
can
t
convince
you
of
what
s
in
my
heart
said
she
with
sweet
resignation
i
had
no
right
to
expect
it
to
hope
for
it
but
my
life
will
convince
you
godfrey
i
shall
win
you
back
i
retained
my
appearance
of
calmness
but
i
was
the
reverse
of
calm
i
appreciated
that
she
had
me
in
her
power
so
far
as
i
could
judge
she
was
not
after
more
money
but
was
under
the
spell
of
some
form
of
hysteria
that
gave
her
the
delusion
of
an
actual
desire
to
love
me
and
to
be
loved
by
me
as
she
had
a
fortune
in
her
own
right
and
a
large
one
i
was
without
means
of
controlling
her
i
could
not
compel
her
to
stick
to
her
bargain
and
make
the
divorce
legally
final
and
even
if
i
had
been
so
disposed
i
had
no
ground
for
a
divorce
from
her
unless
she
should
be
consenting
and
assisting
if
you
cared
for
another
woman
i
might
despair
she
went
on
but
you
don
t
my
heart
tells
me
that
you
don
t
should
i
tell
her
i
strangled
the
impulse
as
it
was
born
my
common
sense
lost
no
time
in
reminding
me
of
the
folly
of
that
course
i
ll
be
so
utterly
yours
godfrey
she
went
on
that
you
ll
simply
have
to
love
me
i
rose
let
s
have
no
more
of
this
nonsense
said
i
understand
once
for
all
edna
the
day
when
you
can
use
me
is
past
gone
forever
you
are
free
and
so
am
i
we
will
annoy
each
other
no
more
she
faced
me
her
bosom
heaving
her
widening
eyes
scrutinizing
me
and
what
i
saw
in
them
made
me
quail
for
there
shone
the
arch
fiend
jealousy
godfrey
she
exclaimed
at
last
it
must
be
another
woman
i
laughed
not
pleasantly
i
imagine
is
there
no
end
to
your
vanity
said
i
another
woman
she
repeated
dazedly
if
that
weren
t
true
you
couldn
t
treat
me
harshly
you
would
want
me
back
would
love
me
if
there
were
not
another
woman
on
earth
i
would
not
go
back
to
you
said
i
but
what
woman
would
believe
that
of
a
man
especially
of
one
upon
whom
she
had
put
her
private
brand
she
said
in
the
same
slow
ferocious
way
some
woman
has
hold
of
you
is
getting
ready
to
make
a
fool
of
you
i
laughed
nervously
watching
her
mind
dart
from
woman
to
woman
of
those
we
knew
ah
you
can
t
deceive
me
she
cried
mary
kirkwood
she
has
been
stealing
you
away
from
me
and
you
a
fool
like
all
men
where
women
are
concerned
can
t
see
through
her
edna
laughed
wildly
but
she
has
me
to
reckon
with
now
i
ll
show
her
mrs
kirkwood
is
engaged
to
hartley
beechman
said
i
a
nobody
of
a
novelist
said
edna
that
s
a
mere
blind
she
s
after
you
after
my
husband
the
man
i
love
we
ll
see
again
i
laughed
and
i
am
sure
my
counterfeit
of
indifference
was
successful
have
it
your
way
said
i
but
the
fact
remains
that
you
and
i
are
done
with
each
other
i
shall
set
aside
the
divorce
said
she
as
you
please
replied
i
lighting
a
cigarette
and
preparing
to
leave
the
room
if
you
are
not
content
with
the
terms
of
settlement
you
can
have
more
money
if
that
why
do
i
love
you
cried
she
all
softness
and
piteous
appeal
again
you
who
are
so
base
that
you
think
only
of
money
what
weakness
for
me
to
love
you
yet
god
help
me
i
do
i
do
godfrey
i
am
going
back
to
london
said
i
she
stretched
out
her
arms
and
her
face
was
a
grief
stricken
appeal
for
mercy
you
can
t
be
so
cruel
to
me
your
edna
i
smiled
mockingly
at
her
and
left
the
room
xii
i
have
not
been
unaware
of
your
anger
and
disgust
with
me
gentle
reader
during
the
progress
of
the
preceding
scene
in
real
life
in
your
own
life
you
would
have
understood
such
a
scene
but
you
are
not
in
the
habit
of
reading
realities
in
books
real
men
real
women
real
action
everything
is
there
toned
down
put
in
what
is
called
an
artistic
perspective
well
i
am
not
an
artist
and
perhaps
i
have
no
right
to
express
an
opinion
upon
matters
of
art
but
i
ll
venture
to
me
art
means
a
point
of
view
upon
life
so
i
see
nothing
artistic
nothing
but
more
or
less
grotesque
nonsense
in
an
art
that
is
not
a
point
of
view
but
a
false
view
but
to
keep
to
edna
and
myself
you
think
i
should
have
been
moist
and
mushy
should
have
taken
her
back
should
have
burdened
myself
for
the
rest
of
my
days
with
her
insincere
and
unsympathetic
personality
you
are
saying
but
after
all
she
loved
him
even
so
what
does
the
word
love
mean
when
used
by
a
person
of
her
character
it
means
nothing
but
the
narrowest
blighting
selfishness
she
had
for
years
used
me
without
any
thought
for
or
of
my
feelings
wishes
needs
when
we
moved
into
our
grand
new
york
house
she
gave
me
as
a
bedroom
the
noisiest
room
in
the
house
one
overlooking
the
street
where
the
rattling
of
carriages
cabs
and
carts
and
the
talk
and
laughter
of
pedestrians
kept
me
awake
until
far
into
the
night
and
roused
me
about
four
in
the
morning
this
when
i
was
working
with
might
and
main
all
day
long
and
needed
every
moment
of
rest
i
could
get
why
did
she
give
me
that
room
because
she
wanted
the
only
available
quiet
room
beside
her
own
bedroom
for
a
dressing
room
she
said
the
light
in
the
room
she
gave
me
was
unfit
to
dress
by
i
thought
nothing
of
all
this
at
the
time
it
is
characteristic
of
american
wives
to
do
these
things
it
is
characteristic
of
american
men
to
regard
them
as
the
matter
of
course
i
cite
the
small
but
not
insignificant
incident
to
show
the
minuteness
of
her
indifference
to
me
i
have
already
given
many
of
the
larger
though
perhaps
less
important
instances
and
i
could
give
scores
hundreds
in
the
same
tenor
she
professed
to
love
me
at
that
time
and
she
either
had
or
simulated
a
very
ardent
passion
but
that
was
not
love
was
it
love
is
generous
is
considerate
finds
its
highest
pleasure
of
self
gratification
in
making
the
loved
one
happy
such
a
conception
of
love
never
entered
her
head
and
how
many
american
women
s
heads
does
it
enter
how
it
amuses
me
to
watch
them
as
they
absorb
everything
give
nothing
sit
enthroned
upon
their
vanities
and
then
wonder
and
grow
sulky
or
sour
when
their
husbands
or
lovers
tire
of
the
thankless
task
of
loving
them
and
turn
away
or
turn
them
away
if
edna
had
awakened
to
genuine
love
gentle
outraged
reader
would
she
not
have
been
overwhelmed
with
shame
as
she
looked
back
upon
her
married
life
would
she
have
come
to
me
with
the
offer
of
her
love
as
a
queen
with
the
offer
of
her
crown
she
would
not
have
indulged
in
empty
words
she
would
have
tried
to
do
something
by
way
of
reparation
she
would
not
have
demanded
that
she
be
taken
back
but
feeling
that
she
had
forfeited
her
rights
she
would
have
tried
to
find
out
whether
i
would
consent
to
take
her
back
and
if
she
had
found
that
i
would
not
she
would
have
accepted
her
fate
as
her
desert
in
those
circumstances
do
you
think
i
could
have
laughed
at
her
and
remained
firm
no
one
not
a
monster
could
have
done
that
but
the
thing
she
called
love
was
not
love
at
all
was
merely
as
i
described
it
to
her
a
newly
discovered
way
of
using
me
after
she
had
thought
all
possible
use
for
me
exhausted
such
gentle
reader
is
the
simple
truth
yet
because
i
had
intelligence
enough
to
see
the
truth
and
firmness
enough
not
to
be
swayed
by
shallow
and
meaningless
sentimentalities
you
call
me
hard
harsh
cruel
one
of
your
impulsive
kindly
souls
would
have
taken
her
weeping
to
his
arms
would
have
begun
to
live
with
her
and
there
the
novel
would
have
ended
with
you
gentle
reader
all
tears
and
thrills
for
having
no
imagination
you
would
have
been
unable
to
picture
the
few
weeks
of
cat
and
dog
life
after
the
happy
ending
then
the
breaking
apart
in
hatred
and
vindictiveness
but
this
is
not
an
artistic
novel
it
is
a
story
of
life
a
plain
setting
forth
of
actualities
in
the
hope
that
it
may
enable
some
men
and
women
to
understand
life
more
clearly
and
to
live
their
own
lives
more
wisely
and
perhaps
less
mischievously
i
went
to
my
daughter
margot
said
i
your
mother
threatens
to
try
to
stop
the
divorce
it
is
best
for
both
her
and
me
that
we
be
free
i
am
determined
not
to
live
with
her
again
for
i
abominate
the
sort
of
life
she
and
you
lead
if
you
will
do
what
you
can
to
bring
her
to
her
senses
i
will
see
that
you
don
t
regret
it
margot
rather
liked
me
i
believe
not
as
a
father
as
a
father
i
made
her
ashamed
like
everything
else
american
about
her
but
it
was
a
resigned
kind
of
shame
and
she
appreciated
my
money
my
good
nature
about
it
and
my
services
in
bringing
back
her
marquis
and
making
possible
her
son
the
earl
i
knew
i
could
count
on
her
active
sympathy
for
she
would
vastly
prefer
that
her
mother
be
the
princess
frascatoni
my
mother
mrs
loring
my
mother
the
princess
frascatoni
pronounce
those
two
phrases
gentle
reader
and
you
will
grasp
my
meaning
i
was
by
no
means
sure
she
would
have
any
influence
with
her
mother
even
though
she
was
now
the
wife
of
one
marquis
and
the
mother
of
a
marquis
to
be
with
about
half
the
high
british
peerage
as
relatives
but
i
was
desperate
and
a
desperate
man
clutches
at
anything
i
think
you
are
right
papa
said
she
in
her
mother
s
own
grave
sweet
way
you
and
mamma
never
have
been
suited
to
each
other
besides
i
don
t
want
her
away
off
in
america
where
i
never
expect
to
be
again
some
of
the
girls
who
have
married
here
like
to
go
back
there
and
receive
the
flattery
and
the
homage
but
it
seems
cheap
to
me
i
m
sure
i
don
t
care
what
the
americans
think
of
me
i
m
not
snobbish
as
i
used
to
be
i
am
english
now
loyal
english
to
the
core
this
is
the
place
for
your
mother
too
an
idea
occurred
to
me
if
i
took
your
mother
back
with
me
i
would
have
my
parents
and
hers
live
with
us
in
a
big
place
i
m
going
to
buy
in
the
country
you
don
t
know
your
grandparents
well
she
was
coloring
deeply
she
must
have
heard
more
than
her
mother
dreamed
she
knew
no
papa
said
she
your
mother
and
i
were
disgracefully
neglectful
of
them
pursued
i
but
i
shall
make
up
for
it
as
far
as
i
can
i
wish
you
would
come
over
and
visit
us
i
should
like
it
papa
murmured
she
ready
to
sink
down
with
shame
they
are
plain
people
i
went
on
but
they
are
good
and
honest
much
ahead
of
these
wretched
parasites
you
ve
been
brought
up
among
talk
to
your
mother
about
them
tell
her
what
i
have
said
she
understood
thoroughly
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
fashionable
people
always
understand
i
shall
papa
said
she
and
i
could
see
her
putting
on
a
fetching
air
of
sweet
innocence
and
telling
her
mother
and
if
she
does
not
like
it
continued
i
can
t
bear
the
scandal
and
ridicule
among
her
fashionable
friends
why
she
can
desert
me
and
that
would
give
me
ground
for
divorce
she
would
be
dreadfully
unhappy
over
there
said
margot
i
am
sure
of
it
said
i
and
my
accent
was
a
guarantee
should
i
see
edna
again
and
picture
our
life
together
in
the
house
of
love
she
was
bent
upon
i
decided
against
it
margot
s
pictures
might
lack
the
energy
and
detail
of
mine
they
would
more
than
make
up
in
bringing
home
to
her
the
awful
reality
as
she
would
believe
margot
where
she
might
suspect
me
of
merely
threatening
what
i
would
never
carry
out
so
off
i
went
to
london
to
wait
about
the
hardest
task
in
this
world
is
inaction
when
every
fiber
of
your
being
is
clamorous
for
action
yet
i
contrived
to
sit
tight
for
a
week
for
two
weeks
i
have
always
regarded
myself
as
too
impatient
too
impetuous
and
beyond
question
my
natural
tendency
is
to
the
precipitate
but
looking
back
over
my
life
i
am
astonished
and
not
a
little
pleased
with
myself
as
i
note
how
i
have
held
myself
in
check
have
confined
my
follies
of
rash
haste
to
occasions
when
miscarriage
was
not
a
serious
matter
armitage
came
on
the
way
from
st
moritz
to
america
as
soon
as
i
could
command
the
right
tone
i
said
you
ve
seen
your
sister
and
mrs
armstrong
how
are
they
all
right
replied
he
indifferently
motoring
in
spain
at
present
i
believe
beechman
he
s
with
them
no
he
s
somewhere
hereabouts
i
believe
i
saw
him
in
hyde
park
the
other
day
looking
as
seedy
as
if
he
were
pulling
out
of
an
illness
i
spoke
and
he
stared
and
scowled
and
nodded
like
the
bounder
that
he
is
you
don
t
care
for
him
said
i
rejoiced
by
this
news
of
my
rival
s
seediness
oh
one
doesn
t
bother
to
like
or
dislike
that
sort
of
chap
he
said
this
in
a
supercilious
manner
a
manner
he
had
never
had
in
the
earlier
period
of
our
acquaintance
how
the
inner
man
does
poke
through
the
surface
when
the
veneer
of
youth
wears
thin
for
one
who
despises
birth
and
wealth
and
rank
said
i
not
without
a
certain
malice
you
have
a
queer
way
of
talking
at
times
armitage
winced
changed
the
subject
by
saying
and
what
the
devil
s
the
matter
with
you
you
re
looking
anything
but
fit
yourself
oh
i
m
up
against
it
as
usual
said
i
gloomily
he
laughed
my
pessimism
was
one
of
the
jokes
of
my
friends
but
having
seen
so
much
of
the
ravages
of
optimism
of
the
cheer
boys
cheer
and
always
look
at
the
bright
side
sort
of
thing
i
had
given
myself
the
habit
of
reckoning
in
the
possibilities
of
disaster
at
full
value
when
i
made
plans
little
people
ought
always
to
be
optimistic
then
their
enthusiasm
if
directed
by
some
big
person
produces
good
results
where
they
would
avail
nothing
could
they
see
the
dangers
in
advance
but
big
people
must
not
be
and
are
not
optimists
whatever
they
may
pretend
the
big
man
must
foresee
all
the
chances
against
success
then
if
his
judgment
tells
him
there
is
still
a
chance
for
success
his
courage
of
the
big
man
will
enable
him
to
go
firmly
ahead
not
blunderingly
but
wisely
the
general
must
be
pessimist
the
private
must
be
optimist
for
if
he
were
pessimist
if
he
saw
what
the
general
must
see
he
would
be
paralyzed
with
fear
and
doubt
you
re
always
grumbling
said
armitage
yet
you
re
the
luckiest
man
i
know
perhaps
that
s
why
replied
i
he
understood
nodded
doubtless
said
he
what
s
luck
nothing
but
shrewd
calculation
the
fellow
who
can
t
calculate
soon
loses
any
windfalls
that
may
happen
to
blunder
his
way
but
what
s
the
grouch
now
i
was
so
helplessly
befogged
that
i
resolved
to
tell
him
my
late
wife
is
threatening
not
to
release
me
said
i
he
smiled
curiously
but
she
hasn
t
done
it
yet
not
yet
replied
i
at
least
not
up
to
eleven
o
clock
this
morning
new
york
time
i
don
t
think
she
will
said
he
why
demanded
i
you
won
t
let
her
for
one
reason
replied
he
you
re
as
fond
of
your
freedom
as
i
am
and
nothing
on
earth
could
induce
me
to
marry
again
when
women
english
women
look
at
me
i
see
them
fairly
twitching
to
get
me
where
they
can
make
free
use
of
me
yes
marriage
has
gone
the
way
of
everything
else
business
finance
politics
religion
they
ve
all
degenerated
into
so
many
means
of
graft
and
art
s
going
the
same
way
and
marriage
it
s
the
woman
s
great
and
only
graft
our
women
look
at
marriage
in
two
ways
how
much
can
be
got
out
of
it
living
with
the
man
how
much
will
it
net
as
alimony
you
seemed
rather
positive
that
my
late
wife
would
not
hold
on
to
me
persisted
i
he
eyed
me
sharply
you
really
wish
to
be
free
i
am
determined
to
be
free
she
s
a
charming
a
lovely
woman
said
he
there
was
doubt
of
my
candor
in
his
eyes
it
is
all
but
impossible
for
a
man
rightly
to
judge
any
woman
except
her
he
has
tired
of
or
for
some
other
reason
does
not
want
and
cannot
imagine
himself
wanting
the
unpossessed
woman
has
but
the
one
value
the
possessed
woman
must
have
other
values
or
she
has
none
armitage
could
judge
edna
only
as
female
unpossessed
female
said
he
she
s
a
charming
a
lovely
woman
like
the
former
mrs
armitage
i
reminded
him
so
so
conceded
he
but
i
ve
always
believed
you
were
a
fond
husband
at
bottom
dismiss
it
from
your
mind
said
i
you
are
hesitating
about
telling
me
something
say
it
with
a
certain
nervousness
he
yielded
to
his
love
of
gossip
prince
frascatoni
you
know
him
i
beamed
in
a
reassuring
smile
my
late
wife
s
chief
admirer
said
i
a
fine
fellow
i
like
him
he
s
visiting
down
at
what
s
the
name
of
the
place
your
son
in
law
has
taken
he
is
exclaimed
i
jubilantly
when
did
he
go
about
a
week
i
hear
that
looks
encouraging
doesn
t
it
cried
i
it
certainly
does
said
he
they
say
he
was
charging
round
town
like
a
lunatic
up
to
a
few
weeks
ago
two
weeks
ago
said
i
but
now
he
has
calmed
again
looks
serene
i
had
a
note
from
him
this
morning
i
m
positive
he
s
content
with
the
way
the
cards
are
falling
the
change
in
me
was
so
radical
that
armitage
must
have
been
convinced
for
the
moment
if
i
only
knew
said
i
i
can
find
out
for
you
suggested
he
your
daughter
has
asked
me
down
for
the
week
end
i
ll
sacrifice
myself
if
you
wish
i
ll
take
your
going
as
a
special
favor
said
i
besides
he
went
on
these
anglo
american
menages
interest
me
american
women
are
so
brash
with
the
men
of
their
own
country
i
like
to
see
them
playing
the
part
of
meek
upper
servants
the
only
kind
of
wife
to
have
is
a
grateful
one
to
get
a
grateful
wife
an
american
has
to
marry
some
poor
creature
homely
neglected
by
everyone
till
he
came
along
even
then
the
odds
are
two
to
one
she
ll
go
crazy
about
herself
and
despise
him
because
he
stooped
to
her
if
she
can
t
find
any
other
excuse
but
a
titled
foreigner
an
american
girl
is
on
her
knees
at
once
and
stays
there
he
can
abuse
her
step
on
her
kill
her
almost
neglect
her
waste
her
money
she
is
still
humbly
grateful
the
worms
have
been
known
to
turn
protested
i
for
while
i
could
not
deny
the
general
truth
of
armitage
s
attack
i
felt
he
was
whipped
too
far
by
bitterness
that
he
for
lack
of
a
title
could
not
command
what
these
inferior
men
with
titles
had
offered
to
them
without
the
bother
of
asking
not
a
worm
declared
he
no
american
woman
ever
divorced
a
title
unless
she
was
either
in
terror
of
her
life
or
in
terror
of
being
robbed
to
the
last
penny
and
kicked
out
thank
god
all
our
women
aren
t
title
crazy
said
i
how
do
you
know
they
aren
t
retorted
he
do
you
know
one
who
has
been
tempted
and
has
resisted
i
had
to
confess
i
did
not
then
you
thanked
god
too
soon
the
truth
is
our
women
are
brought
up
to
be
snobs
spenders
useless
vain
parasites
their
systems
are
all
ready
to
be
infected
with
the
title
mania
armitage
on
his
favorite
subject
talked
and
talked
i
did
not
listen
attentively
not
so
much
because
i
did
not
like
what
he
was
saying
or
because
i
thought
him
prejudiced
as
because
i
knew
him
to
be
a
secret
snob
of
the
thoroughgoing
variety
i
suspected
that
if
things
were
reversed
if
he
could
get
a
title
by
marriage
and
a
position
that
would
enable
him
to
swagger
and
would
make
everyone
bow
and
scrape
he
would
put
the
eagerest
of
the
female
title
hunters
to
the
blush
it
may
be
just
and
proper
to
criticise
women
for
being
what
they
are
but
let
us
also
hear
in
mind
that
it
is
not
their
fault
but
the
fault
of
their
training
also
that
the
men
do
no
better
when
they
have
the
chance
to
live
in
idle
vanity
upon
the
labors
of
some
one
else
on
the
following
monday
my
emissary
returned
from
garton
hall
full
to
the
brim
with
news
but
first
he
had
again
to
assure
himself
that
there
was
no
pretense
in
my
seeming
anxiety
to
be
free
i
saw
doubt
of
me
in
his
eyes
before
he
began
his
adroit
cross
examination
i
gave
no
sign
that
i
knew
what
he
was
about
for
in
those
cases
the
one
chance
of
convincing
is
to
submit
to
whatever
tests
may
be
applied
it
was
not
unnatural
that
he
should
doubt
coming
as
he
did
direct
from
seeing
and
talking
with
the
charming
edna
men
are
habitually
fools
about
women
not
because
women
make
fools
of
them
but
because
they
enjoy
the
sensation
of
making
fools
of
themselves
that
is
a
sensation
much
praised
by
poets
romancers
sentimentalists
of
all
kinds
and
because
of
this
praise
it
has
come
to
have
a
certain
fictitious
value
has
come
to
be
a
cheap
way
for
a
man
to
imagine
himself
a
devil
of
a
fellow
a
figure
of
romantic
recklessness
there
is
no
limit
to
which
the
passion
for
living
up
to
a
pose
will
not
carry
a
man
men
have
flung
away
their
fortunes
their
lives
for
the
sake
of
a
pose
martyrs
have
burned
at
the
stake
for
pose
so
a
man
of
experience
even
more
than
your
ordinary
brick
brained
citizen
is
distrustful
of
his
fellow
men
where
women
are
concerned
and
it
is
nothing
against
armitage
s
intelligence
nor
any
sign
of
his
having
a
low
estimate
of
my
strength
of
mind
that
he
tried
to
make
absolutely
sure
of
me
before
proceeding
then
too
there
was
edna
s
charm
women
i
mean
our
fashionable
and
would
be
fashionable
american
women
of
all
classes
from
fifth
avenue
to
the
bowery
from
maine
to
the
pacific
women
are
parlor
bred
are
bred
to
make
an
imposing
surface
impression
the
best
of
them
fool
the
most
expert
man
as
edna
had
been
fooling
armitage
during
those
two
days
down
in
the
country
a
man
has
to
live
with
them
to
find
them
out
and
often
our
men
being
extremely
busy
and
kindly
disposed
toward
their
women
and
unobservant
of
them
and
uncritical
of
them
do
not
find
them
out
for
many
years
the
house
is
run
badly
the
money
is
wasted
the
children
are
not
brought
up
right
but
the
man
lets
it
pass
as
part
of
the
game
he
tells
himself
that
not
much
but
good
looks
is
to
be
expected
of
a
woman
he
buries
himself
still
deeper
in
his
business
then
if
he
is
a
successful
man
along
about
forty
when
he
has
got
up
high
enough
to
be
able
to
relax
from
the
labor
of
his
career
and
thinks
of
enjoying
himself
he
tries
to
form
an
alliance
for
pleasure
with
his
wife
and
lo
and
behold
he
discovers
that
he
is
married
to
a
vain
superficial
fool
there
could
have
been
no
more
delightful
experience
than
passing
a
few
days
in
the
society
of
edna
she
had
educated
herself
admirably
thoroughly
for
show
she
could
have
fooled
the
fashionable
man
his
whole
life
through
for
one
cannot
see
beyond
the
range
of
his
own
vision
she
might
have
fooled
many
a
serious
man
of
the
narrow
type
an
excellent
shoemaker
might
easily
be
misled
by
a
clever
showy
jack
of
all
trades
into
thinking
him
a
master
of
all
trades
so
long
as
he
avoided
betraying
his
ignorance
of
shoemaking
but
your
successful
american
man
of
the
highest
type
having
a
broad
range
of
practical
interests
becomes
a
shrewd
judge
of
human
values
thus
the
american
woman
who
can
pass
for
brilliant
in
fashionable
society
at
home
or
abroad
cannot
deceive
the
american
man
for
long
not
when
he
lives
with
her
no
wonder
she
finds
him
coarse
who
does
not
wince
when
vanity
is
stepped
on
or
ignored
no
wonder
she
thinks
him
uninteresting
a
child
would
have
an
equally
poor
opinion
of
any
person
inexpert
at
catcher
marbles
and
mud
pies
armitage
in
a
company
of
titled
people
his
nostrils
full
of
his
beloved
stealthily
enjoyed
perfumes
of
wealth
and
rank
was
captivated
by
edna
if
he
had
stopped
a
week
or
so
his
american
shrewdness
might
have
found
her
out
might
have
seen
why
i
could
view
with
unruffled
sleeves
as
the
chinese
say
the
loss
of
so
lovely
and
lively
a
companion
but
stopping
only
for
the
week
end
he
became
doubtful
of
my
sincerity
i
measured
how
deeply
he
had
been
deluded
when
he
spoke
of
her
keen
sense
of
humor
woman
nature
is
too
practical
too
matter
of
fact
for
even
the
cleverest
of
them
to
have
a
real
sense
of
humor
with
now
and
then
an
exception
of
course
edna
had
not
a
glimmer
of
appreciation
of
either
wit
or
humor
but
only
i
before
whom
she
dropped
all
pretenses
except
those
that
were
essential
to
her
pose
only
i
knew
this
before
the
rest
of
the
world
with
the
aid
of
her
vivacity
what
an
aid
to
women
is
vivacity
how
many
of
them
it
marries
well
with
the
aid
of
her
vivacity
she
made
a
convincing
show
not
only
of
appreciating
humor
and
wit
but
also
of
having
much
of
both
at
precisely
the
right
place
she
gave
the
proper
convincing
charming
exhibition
of
dancing
eyes
and
pearl
white
teeth
and
occasionally
with
a
pretty
liveliness
she
repeated
as
her
own
some
witticism
she
had
heard
much
applauded
in
another
and
remote
company
but
i
do
not
blame
you
ladies
for
your
inveterate
and
incessant
posing
we
men
are
determined
to
idealize
and
to
be
gulled
and
you
need
us
to
pay
for
your
luxury
and
your
finery
i
let
armitage
probe
on
and
on
until
my
impatience
for
his
news
would
suffer
no
further
delay
i
said
i
see
you
refuse
to
be
convinced
so
let
it
go
at
that
and
tell
me
what
you
found
out
is
she
to
marry
frascatoni
as
i
ve
been
telling
you
i
believe
she
is
in
love
with
you
loring
but
is
she
going
to
free
me
unless
you
do
something
pretty
soon
i
m
afraid
you
ll
lose
her
it
was
too
absurd
that
he
who
had
lived
with
one
of
these
showy
vivacious
women
had
found
her
out
and
had
rid
himself
of
her
should
be
thus
taken
in
by
another
of
precisely
the
same
kind
but
that
s
the
way
it
is
with
men
they
understand
why
they
yawn
at
their
own
show
piece
but
they
can
t
appreciate
that
all
show
pieces
in
time
produce
the
same
effect
there
still
remain
three
weeks
before
the
day
on
which
her
lawyers
must
ask
the
judge
to
confirm
the
decree
said
i
do
you
think
she
will
have
them
do
it
or
not
unless
you
get
busy
old
man
but
i
shall
not
get
busy
i
shall
do
everything
i
can
to
encourage
her
to
stay
free
then
you
ll
lose
her
said
he
frascatoni
is
mad
about
her
and
he
knows
how
to
make
an
impression
on
a
woman
it
irritated
me
to
see
a
damned
dago
carrying
off
such
a
prize
and
you
know
i
m
not
prejudiced
in
favor
of
american
women
i
want
to
see
her
happy
said
i
she
will
be
happy
with
him
so
i
hope
he
gets
her
i
laughed
mockingly
she
wouldn
t
be
happy
with
an
american
bob
not
even
with
you
he
colored
guiltily
that
idea
never
entered
my
head
protested
he
but
i
laughed
the
more
and
she
wouldn
t
have
you
bob
i
went
on
so
don
t
put
yourself
in
the
way
of
being
made
uncomfortable
he
had
enjoyed
himself
hugely
not
only
was
my
former
wife
most
entertaining
but
also
margot
she
had
beyond
question
been
beautifully
educated
for
the
part
she
was
to
take
in
life
her
manner
so
armitage
assured
me
was
the
perfection
of
gracious
simplicity
the
most
exquisite
exhibition
of
the
perfect
lady
note
how
ladylike
i
am
yet
how
i
treat
you
as
if
you
were
my
equal
gracious
there
s
the
word
that
expresses
the
whole
thing
and
she
had
a
quantity
of
bright
parlor
tricks
french
recitation
a
little
ladylike
singing
in
a
pleasant
plaintive
soprano
that
gave
people
an
excuse
for
saying
she
could
have
been
a
grand
opera
star
if
she
had
cared
to
go
in
seriously
for
that
sort
of
thing
also
a
graceful
skirt
dance
and
a
killing
cake
walk
she
had
an
effective
line
of
fashionable
conversation
too
about
books
and
pictures
analysis
of
soul
states
mystic
love
theories
all
the
paraphernalia
of
a
first
class
heroine
of
a
first
class
society
novel
and
you
gentle
reader
who
know
nothing
would
never
have
dreamed
that
she
knew
nothing
you
who
are
futile
would
not
have
seen
how
worthless
she
was
except
to
do
skirt
dances
well
enough
for
a
drawing
room
or
to
talk
soul
states
well
enough
for
a
society
novel
the
more
armitage
discoursed
of
the
delights
of
his
little
visit
the
more
nervous
i
became
lest
edna
should
again
change
her
mind
and
inflict
me
further
what
he
had
said
brought
back
my
life
with
her
in
stinging
vividness
i
lived
again
the
days
of
my
self
deception
the
darker
days
of
my
slow
awakening
the
black
days
of
my
full
realization
of
the
mess
my
life
was
and
of
my
feeling
that
there
was
no
escape
for
me
i
will
admit
loring
said
armitage
that
as
women
go
our
women
are
the
best
of
all
yes
i
assented
sincerely
and
they
ought
to
be
america
is
the
best
place
to
grow
men
why
shouldn
t
it
be
the
best
place
to
grow
women
he
did
not
pursue
the
subject
in
his
heart
he
disagreed
with
me
for
he
was
wholly
out
of
conceit
with
everything
american
his
pose
had
been
the
other
way
and
he
shrank
from
uncovering
himself
a
day
or
so
later
i
was
crossing
green
park
when
i
ran
straight
into
hartley
beechman
i
smiled
pleasantly
though
not
too
cordially
he
planted
himself
in
front
of
me
and
stared
with
a
tragic
frown
i
then
noted
that
he
verged
on
the
unkempt
that
he
had
skipped
his
morning
shave
and
perhaps
his
bath
his
stare
was
unmistakably
offensive
the
look
of
a
man
who
is
seeking
a
quarrel
how
re
you
beechman
said
i
ignoring
the
signs
of
foul
weather
armitage
told
me
you
were
in
town
but
didn
t
know
your
address
stopping
long
you
are
a
scoundrel
said
he
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
as
i
was
much
the
larger
and
stronger
man
i
could
afford
to
do
it
so
i
ve
often
heard
said
i
perhaps
it
s
true
what
of
it
why
should
you
think
i
cared
to
know
your
opinion
of
me
if
i
send
you
a
challenge
will
you
accept
it
i
laughed
no
i
never
pay
the
slightest
attention
to
crank
letters
you
are
a
coward
you
will
not
give
me
a
chance
to
meet
you
on
equal
terms
i
ll
take
you
over
my
knee
and
give
you
a
spanking
if
you
don
t
behave
yourself
said
i
and
i
pushed
him
out
of
my
path
and
was
passing
on
you
took
her
away
from
me
he
jeered
but
it
will
do
you
no
good
she
is
laughing
at
us
both
i
strode
away
i
had
heard
enough
to
put
me
in
high
good
humor
as
the
end
of
my
wait
upon
the
anxious
seat
drew
into
its
last
week
i
fell
into
a
state
of
deep
depression
too
much
eating
and
drinking
was
of
course
the
cause
but
i
had
to
pass
the
time
somehow
and
what
is
there
to
do
in
london
but
eat
and
drink
four
days
before
the
last
rossiter
came
into
my
sitting
room
with
the
news
that
edna
was
calling
there
arose
a
nice
question
would
i
better
send
word
i
was
out
or
see
her
because
of
my
knowledge
of
her
persistence
where
her
interest
was
really
engaged
i
decided
to
see
her
and
have
done
with
so
in
she
came
vivacious
radiant
dressed
for
a
scene
in
which
she
was
to
be
heroine
as
i
saw
at
a
glance
pray
don
t
think
i
m
going
to
repeat
what
i
did
the
other
day
cried
she
by
way
of
beginning
i
m
in
quite
another
mood
so
i
see
said
i
i
was
horribly
ashamed
and
disgusted
with
myself
afterwards
she
went
on
you
must
have
thought
me
crazy
in
fact
you
did
you
treated
me
as
if
i
were
won
t
you
sit
said
i
arranging
a
chair
for
her
she
smiled
mischievously
at
me
as
she
seated
herself
you
do
know
something
about
women
said
she
you
put
this
chair
so
that
my
face
would
be
spared
the
strong
light
as
she
said
this
she
turned
into
the
full
strength
of
the
light
a
face
as
free
as
a
girl
s
from
wrinkles
or
any
other
sign
of
years
you
certainly
do
know
something
about
women
very
little
said
i
for
it
was
not
a
time
to
pause
and
poke
a
finger
into
the
swelling
bubble
of
woman
s
baffling
complexity
and
unfathomable
mystery
you
ve
come
to
tell
me
what
it
was
you
wanted
the
other
day
she
shook
her
head
she
was
wearing
a
charming
hat
but
her
costumes
were
never
indifferent
and
nearly
always
charming
a
feat
the
more
remarkable
because
she
being
a
timidly
conventional
woman
followed
the
fashions
and
ventured
cautiously
and
never
far
in
individual
style
you
re
usually
right
my
dear
said
she
in
your
guesses
at
people
s
underlying
motives
but
you
were
mistaken
that
time
i
wanted
exactly
what
i
said
i
wanted
you
incredible
laughed
i
yes
it
does
sound
so
conceded
she
but
it
s
the
truth
i
had
a
queer
attack
an
attack
of
jealousy
i
d
often
heard
of
that
sort
of
thing
i
fancied
myself
above
it
perhaps
that
was
why
i
fell
such
a
foolish
victim
but
i
ve
recovered
completely
and
her
eyes
were
mocking
me
as
if
she
had
a
secret
joke
on
me
it
couldn
t
last
long
said
i
to
be
saying
something
no
perhaps
not
replied
she
at
any
rate
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
mary
kirkwood
s
engagement
i
was
cured
instantly
cured
i
told
you
she
was
engaged
said
i
oh
i
don
t
mean
that
beechman
person
scoffed
edna
she
was
simply
amusing
herself
with
him
a
woman
a
woman
of
our
world
might
have
an
affair
with
a
man
of
that
sort
as
you
men
sometimes
do
with
queer
women
but
she
wouldn
t
think
of
marrying
him
marriage
is
a
serious
matter
yes
indeed
said
i
it
s
a
woman
s
whole
career
pursued
she
it
means
not
only
her
position
but
the
position
of
her
children
too
very
serious
said
i
no
i
mean
mary
s
engagement
to
count
von
tilzer
borgfeldt
i
hadn
t
heard
of
it
said
i
indifferently
there
could
be
nothing
in
such
a
silly
story
didn
t
bob
armitage
tell
you
not
yet
said
i
but
why
should
he
that
s
queer
mused
she
perhaps
he
thought
there
might
be
a
little
something
in
the
talk
about
you
and
mary
and
that
it
would
be
well
not
to
stir
things
up
that
might
account
for
it
i
agreed
she
was
studying
me
closely
i
believe
you
really
didn
t
care
about
mary
continued
she
i
confess
i
was
astonished
when
i
first
heard
that
you
did
she
s
edna
laughed
hardly
up
to
me
hardly
said
i
but
let
s
not
talk
of
her
i
ve
forgotten
all
that
i
ve
come
to
make
a
last
proposal
to
you
she
was
smiling
but
i
detected
seriousness
in
her
eyes
in
her
unsteady
upper
lip
in
her
hands
trying
not
to
move
restlessly
you
don
t
realize
what
a
strong
hold
you
have
on
me
godfrey
is
it
love
is
it
habit
i
don
t
know
but
i
can
t
shake
it
off
don
t
you
think
me
strange
talking
to
you
in
this
way
why
shouldn
t
you
said
i
it
s
more
like
a
woman
who
isn
t
attractive
to
men
on
the
contrary
said
i
you
speak
like
a
woman
accustomed
to
deal
with
men
according
to
her
own
good
pleasure
how
shrewd
that
is
said
she
with
an
admiring
glance
how
shrewd
you
are
that
s
what
i
miss
in
other
men
in
these
men
over
here
who
have
so
much
that
i
admire
but
they
well
they
give
me
the
feeling
that
they
are
superficial
do
you
think
i
am
superficial
how
could
i
said
i
that
s
an
evasion
laughed
she
you
do
think
so
and
perhaps
i
am
a
woman
ought
to
be
a
man
looks
after
the
serious
side
of
life
the
woman
s
side
is
the
lighter
and
graceful
side
don
t
you
think
so
that
sounds
plausible
said
i
but
i
grow
tired
of
superficial
men
they
give
me
the
feeling
that
well
that
they
couldn
t
be
relied
on
and
you
are
reliable
godfrey
i
feel
about
you
that
no
matter
what
happened
you
d
be
equal
to
it
and
that
s
why
i
don
t
want
to
give
you
up
i
sat
with
my
eyes
down
as
if
i
were
listening
and
reflecting
since
you
ve
been
over
here
long
enough
to
to
broaden
a
little
you
don
t
mind
my
saying
you
ve
broadened
it
s
true
said
i
i
ve
fancied
perhaps
you
might
be
seeing
that
i
wasn
t
altogether
wrong
in
my
ideas
yes
said
i
as
she
hesitated
margot
was
telling
me
about
some
plans
you
had
for
living
on
the
other
side
you
weren
t
in
earnest
i
looked
at
her
gravely
very
much
in
earnest
said
i
i
shall
never
again
in
any
circumstances
live
as
we
used
to
live
she
sank
back
in
her
chair
slowly
turned
her
parasol
round
and
round
then
it
s
hopeless
said
she
with
a
sigh
that
was
a
sob
also
and
the
look
in
the
eyes
she
lifted
to
mine
went
straight
to
my
heart
i
simply
can
t
stand
america
said
she
it
reminds
me
of
she
rose
impatiently
if
you
only
knew
godfrey
how
i
loathe
my
origin
the
dreadful
depth
we
came
from
the
commonness
of
it
she
shuddered
europe
is
the
place
for
you
said
i
yes
it
is
cried
she
and
we
could
be
happy
over
here
if
you
d
only
see
it
in
the
right
light
godfrey
i
don
t
want
to
to
change
won
t
you
compromise
by
conceding
everything
said
i
good
humoredly
by
becoming
the
bedraggled
tail
to
your
gay
and
giddy
kite
you
simply
won
t
reason
about
these
things
exclaimed
she
yet
they
say
men
are
reasonable
my
dear
edna
i
don
t
ask
you
to
make
yourself
wretched
for
my
sake
and
i
don
t
purpose
to
be
wretched
for
your
sake
she
sat
down
again
the
brightness
had
faded
from
her
she
looked
older
than
i
d
have
believed
she
could
well
i
see
it
s
useless
she
said
finally
and
as
i
ve
got
to
stay
over
here
i
simply
must
marry
again
you
understand
that
perfectly
said
i
don
t
you
care
the
least
bit
said
she
wistfully
you
wish
me
to
be
unhappy
about
it
laughed
i
to
gratify
your
vanity
she
sighed
again
you
are
content
with
the
settlements
oh
yes
said
she
wearily
no
doubt
you
gentle
reader
are
now
completely
won
over
to
her
and
think
that
the
least
i
could
in
decency
have
done
would
have
been
to
insist
on
her
accepting
half
my
fortune
i
had
no
impulse
toward
that
folly
there
is
a
kind
of
wife
who
can
justly
claim
that
she
is
the
equal
partner
in
her
husband
s
wealth
but
not
the
edna
kind
i
had
made
my
fortune
in
spite
of
her
nor
was
i
keen
to
give
her
any
more
money
than
i
should
be
compelled
why
turn
over
wealth
to
her
to
fritter
away
and
to
bolster
the
pretensions
of
a
family
of
worthless
italian
aristocrats
with
a
sudden
darting
look
at
me
she
said
you
know
frascatoni
what
do
you
think
of
him
a
fine
specimen
said
i
a
fascinating
man
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
fascinating
enough
i
suppose
but
would
you
trust
him
i
would
not
replied
i
nor
any
other
man
i
have
long
since
learned
not
to
trust
even
myself
but
i
d
trust
him
as
far
as
the
next
man
as
far
as
it
s
necessary
to
trust
anyone
she
nodded
in
appreciation
and
agreement
i
believe
he
genuinely
cares
for
me
she
said
adding
with
a
melancholy
look
at
me
and
it
s
pleasant
to
be
cared
about
so
i
have
heard
said
i
you
never
wanted
anyone
to
care
about
you
said
she
you
are
independent
of
everything
and
everybody
that
s
safest
said
i
she
did
not
reply
after
reflecting
she
burst
out
with
you
ought
to
have
made
me
godfrey
ought
to
have
trained
me
to
your
taste
women
have
to
be
made
even
if
that
had
been
possible
in
this
case
i
observed
i
didn
t
know
enough
again
she
thought
a
long
time
then
with
a
sigh
she
said
but
it
s
too
late
now
you
re
right
it
s
too
late
it
puzzled
me
to
note
how
much
the
world
had
taught
her
in
some
ways
and
how
little
in
others
but
that
is
a
familiar
puzzle
the
unexpected
startling
ways
in
which
knowledge
juts
out
into
ignorance
and
ignorance
closes
in
upon
knowledge
forming
a
coast
line
between
the
land
of
knowledge
and
the
sea
of
ignorance
more
jagged
than
that
of
alaska
or
norway
the
result
is
that
each
of
us
is
a
confused
contention
of
wisdom
and
folly
in
which
the
imperious
instincts
of
elemental
passions
and
appetites
by
their
steady
persistence
easily
get
their
way
since
i
ve
begun
to
look
at
these
foreign
men
seriously
she
went
on
to
study
them
it
s
one
thing
to
size
them
up
as
you
say
in
america
with
the
idea
that
they
re
mere
outsiders
acquaintances
social
friends
it
s
very
different
to
measure
them
with
a
view
to
serious
relations
i
m
not
altogether
a
fool
even
from
your
standpoint
am
i
godfrey
distinctly
not
said
i
since
i
ve
been
studying
these
upper
class
men
over
here
i
ve
changed
my
mind
in
some
respects
i
m
not
a
child
you
know
i
haven
t
done
what
i
ve
done
without
using
some
judgment
of
men
and
women
she
flooded
me
with
a
smile
of
gratitude
i
owe
my
judgment
to
you
godfrey
you
taught
me
you
never
agreed
with
anything
i
said
when
i
did
occasionally
venture
an
opinion
because
a
woman
disagrees
and
scorns
it
doesn
t
follow
that
she
isn
t
convinced
you
ve
changed
your
mind
about
these
men
said
i
for
my
curiosity
was
aroused
i
find
a
lack
in
them
you
re
right
to
a
certain
extent
godfrey
they
are
futile
the
cleverest
of
them
culture
gives
a
great
deal
of
course
what
said
i
it
s
too
long
and
involved
to
explain
and
you
don
t
believe
in
it
i
m
willing
to
said
i
but
first
i
d
like
to
know
what
it
is
and
second
i
d
like
to
know
what
it
does
i
ve
never
been
able
to
get
anything
but
words
in
answer
to
either
question
well
i
see
that
it
gives
a
great
deal
but
i
must
admit
that
it
takes
away
something
yes
much
strength
from
the
mind
and
softness
from
the
heart
i
was
astonished
at
this
admission
from
her
at
the
admission
itself
at
the
fresh
evidences
of
what
a
good
natural
mind
she
had
but
i
had
no
desire
to
discuss
with
her
i
had
long
outgrown
the
folly
of
discussion
with
futile
people
i
was
tempted
to
air
my
own
views
of
this
so
called
culture
how
it
emasculated
where
it
pretended
to
soften
how
it
discovered
nothing
invented
nothing
produced
nothing
did
not
feed
or
clothe
or
shelter
or
in
any
way
contribute
to
the
sane
happiness
of
a
human
being
how
it
unfitted
men
and
women
for
active
life
made
them
pitiful
spectators
merely
scoffing
or
smiling
superciliously
at
the
battle
but
i
refrained
i
knew
she
believed
the
r
le
of
spectator
the
only
one
worthy
a
lady
or
a
gentleman
and
certainly
it
is
the
only
one
either
lady
or
gentleman
could
take
without
being
exposed
as
ridiculous
i
knew
that
her
wise
observations
were
clever
conversation
merely
after
the
manner
of
futile
people
that
when
the
time
for
action
came
her
snobbishness
dominated
her
i
wish
these
men
were
not
so
so
good
for
nothing
i
suggested
she
accepted
the
phrase
though
she
would
have
preferred
one
less
mercilessly
truthful
you
can
t
find
everything
in
one
person
said
i
that
kind
of
tame
generality
lack
of
interest
thinly
veiled
in
a
polite
show
of
interest
kills
conversation
and

edna
extended
her
arm
resting
her
hand
upon
the
crook
of
her
parasol
in
a
gesture
of
approaching
departure
yet
she
seemed
loth
to
go
she
rose
but
counterbalanced
with
you
know
i
suppose
that
it
s
likely
to
be
frascatoni
i
rose
replied
indifferently
so
i
hear
she
stood
smiling
vaguely
down
at
the
gloved
hand
on
the
crook
of
the
parasol
if
i
were
only
younger
or
more
credulous
said
she
and
i
knew
that
there
was
a
thin
sour
after
taste
to
the
sparkling
wine
of
the
prince
s
love
making
i
smiled
pleasant
noncommittal
i
ask
too
much
of
life
said
she
impatiently
isn
t
it
irritating
that
i
should
become
critical
just
as
i
am
in
a
position
to
get
everything
i
ve
longed
for
and
worked
for
those
moods
pass
said
i
no
doubt
said
she
well
good
by
she
put
out
her
hand
with
a
radiant
smile
i
ll
not
annoy
you
any
more
my
answering
smile
and
pressure
of
the
hand
were
friendly
but
cautiously
so
for
i
felt
i
was
still
on
thin
ice
i
opened
the
door
for
her
we
shook
hands
again
our
eyes
met
i
think
it
must
have
given
each
of
us
a
shock
to
see
in
the
other
s
face
the
polite
distant
look
of
strangers
parting
how
easy
it
is
for
two
to
become
like
one
and
when
they
are
how
impossible
it
seems
that
they
could
ever
be
aliens
how
easy
it
is
for
two
that
are
as
one
to
become
utter
strangers
the
sea
is
wide
and

currents

i
he
was
at
work
in
the
anteroom
take
mrs
loring
to
her
carriage
please
so
she
was
gone
i
was
free
xiii
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
lingered
she
was
gone
i
was
free
her
manner
had
been
the
manner
of
finality
her
reluctance
and
her
sadness
were
little
more
than
the
convention
of
mourning
which
human
beings
feel
compelled
to
display
on
mortuary
occasions
of
all
kinds
beneath
the
crepe
i
saw
a
not
discontented
resignation
a
conviction
of
the
truth
that
life
together
was
impossible
for
her
and
me
my
male
readers
those
who
have
a
thinking
apparatus
and
use
it
will
probably
wonder
as
i
did
then
that
she
had
overlooked
certain
obvious
advantages
to
be
gained
through
refusing
to
divorce
me
she
knew
me
well
enough
to
be
certain
i
would
not
compel
her
to
go
to
america
and
live
with
me
but
if
she
insisted
would
let
her
stay
in
europe
or
wander
where
she
pleased
this
would
have
given
her
all
the
advantages
of
widowhood
free
with
plenty
of
money
she
could
have
led
her
own
life
without
ever
having
to
consult
the
conveniences
and
caprices
of
a
husband
it
seemed
to
me
singularly
stupid
of
her
to
resign
this
signal
advantage
to
tie
herself
to
a
husband
she
could
not
ignore
a
husband
she
already
saw
would
bore
her
as
poseurs
invariably
bore
each
other
to
tie
herself
to
such
a
man
with
no
compensating
advantage
but
a
title
indeed
so
stupid
did
it
seem
that
from
the
moment
she
began
to
waver
about
confirming
the
divorce
i
all
but
lost
hope
of
freedom
my
women
readers
will
understand
her
a
man
cannot
appreciate
how
hampered
a
woman
of
the
lady
class
is
without
a
legitimate
male
attachment
of
some
kind
a
husband
a
brother
or
a
father
in
constant
attendance
ready
for
use
the
instant
the
need
arises
our
whole
society
is
built
upon
the
theory
that
woman
is
the
dependent
the
appendage
of
man
freedom
is
impossible
for
a
woman
except
at
a
price
almost
no
woman
voluntarily
pays
to
have
any
measure
of
freedom
a
woman
must
bind
herself
to
some
man
and
the
bondage
has
to
be
cruel
indeed
not
to
be
preferable
to
the
so
called
freedom
of
the
unattached
female
thus
it
was
not
altogether
snobbishness
it
may
not
have
been
chiefly
snobbishness
that
moved
edna
to
transfer
herself
to
a
husband
who
would
be
a
more
or
less
unpleasant
actuality
she
had
to
have
a
man
she
wished
to
live
abroad
and
to
be
in
fashionable
society
she
chose
shrewdly
i
imagine
from
several
things
she
said
that
she
had
measured
frascatoni
with
calm
impartiality
had
discovered
many
serious
disadvantages
in
him
as
husband
to
a
woman
of
her
fondness
for
her
own
way
but
estimating
the
disadvantages
at
their
worst
the
balance
still
tipped
heavily
toward
him
i
am
glad
i
was
not
born
a
woman
i
pity
the
women
of
our
day
bred
and
educated
in
the
tastes
of
men
yet
compelled
to
be
dependents
and
certain
of
defeat
in
a
finish
contest
with
man
though
there
was
now
no
reasonable
doubt
of
edna
s
having
the
decree
of
divorce
made
final
i
through
overcaution
or
oversensitiveness
as
to
mary
kirkwood
s
rights
or
what
motive
you
please
would
not
let
myself
leave
london
until
a
cable
from
my
lawyers
in
new
york
informed
me
that
the
decree
had
been
entered
and
that
i
was
legally
free
the
newspapers
had
given
much
space
to
our
affairs
it
was
assumed
that
i
had
come
abroad
to
make
last
desperate
efforts
to
win
back
the
beautiful
and
charming
wife
the
favorite
of
fashionable
european
society
stories
had
been
published
giving
in
minute
detail
accounts
of
the
bribes
i
had
offered
and
when
the
final
decree
was
entered
my
chagrin
and
fury
were
pictured
vividly
i
did
nothing
to
discredit
this
but
on
the
contrary
helped
along
the
campaign
for
the
preservation
of
the
literary
and
journalistic
fiction
that
the
american
woman
is
a
kind
of
divine
autocrat
over
mankind
if
i
had
been
so
vain
and
so
ungallant
as
to
try
to
make
the
public
see
the
truth
i
should
have
failed
you
can
discredit
the
truth
to
the
foolish
race
of
men
but
you
cannot
discredit
nor
even
cast
a
shade
of
doubt
upon
a
generally
accepted
fiction
of
sentimentality
and
of
all
the
sentimental
fictions
that
everyone
slobbers
over
but
no
one
in
his
heart
believes
with
the
living
and
only
valid
faith
of
works
the
fictions
about
woman
are
the
most
sacred
further
how
many
men
are
there
who
believe
that
a
man
could
get
enough
of
a
physically
lovely
woman
however
trying
she
might
be
once
in
a
while
in
a
novel
not
often
but
once
in
a
while
there
are
scenes
portraying
with
some
approach
to
fidelity
what
happens
between
a
woman
and
a
man
who
is
of
the
sort
that
is
attractive
to
women
invariably
such
scenes
are
derided
or
denounced
by
the
critics
why
for
an
obvious
reason
a
critic
is
to
put
it
charitably
an
average
man
he
has
no
insight
he
must
rely
for
his
knowledge
of
life
solely
upon
experience
now
what
is
the
average
man
s
experience
of
women
he
treats
them
in
a
certain
dull
conventional
way
and
they
treat
him
as
he
invites
and
compels
so
when
he
reads
how
women
act
toward
a
man
who
does
not
leave
them
cold
or
indifferent
who
rouses
in
them
some
sensation
other
than
wonder
whether
they
would
be
able
to
stomach
him
as
a
husband
the
critic
scoffs
and
waxes
wroth
the
very
idea
that
women
might
be
less
reserved
less
queenly
less
grudgingly
gracious
than
woman
has
ever
been
to
him
sends
shooting
pains
through
his
vanity
and
toothache
and
sciatica
are
mild
compared
with
the
torturings
of
a
pain
shotten
vanity
edna
scored
heavily
in
the
newspapers
you
would
never
have
suspected
it
was
her
late
husband
s
money
that
had
given
her
everything
that
had
made
her
throughout
for
what
had
she
and
what
was
she
except
a
product
of
lavishly
squandered
money
think
about
that
carefully
gentle
reader
before
you
damn
me
and
commiserate
her
as
in
these
pages
a
victim
of
my
venomous
malice
she
was
the
newspaper
heroine
of
the
hour
if
she
had
been
content
with
this
but
i
shall
not
anticipate
my
cable
message
from
new
york
came
at
five
o
clock
at
half
past
six
accompanied
only
by
my
valet
i
was
journeying
toward
switzerland
mrs
kirkwood
i
had
learned
from
her
brother
was
at
territet
at
the
hotel
excelsior
with
the
horace
armstrongs
at
four
the
following
afternoon
i
descended
at
montreux
from
the
milan
express
at
five
with
travel
stains
removed
i
was
in
the
garden
of
the
excelsior
having
tea
with
mrs
armstrong
and
listening
to
her
raptures
over
the
savoy
alps
doubtless
you
know
mrs
armstrong
s
neva
carlin
s
work
her
portrait
of
edna
is
famous
is
one
of
the
best
examples
i
know
of
inside
outness
edna
does
not
like
it
perhaps
for
that
reason
mary
and
horace
armstrong
had
gone
up
to
caux
but
said
neva
they
ll
surely
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
count
von
tilzer
borgfeldt
is
coming
at
half
past
five
i
instantly
recognized
that
name
as
the
one
edna
gave
in
telling
me
that
mary
had
gone
shopping
for
a
title
and
had
invested
i
had
thought
edna
s
jeer
produced
no
effect
upon
me
i
might
have
known
better
my
nature
has
inevitably
been
made
morbidly
suspicious
by
my
business
career
also
i
had
found
out
robert
armitage
as
a
well
veneered
snob
and
this
could
not
but
have
put
me
in
an
attitude
of
watchfulness
toward
his
sister
so
like
him
mentally
also
my
investigations
of
that
most
important
phenomenon
of
american
life
the
american
woman
had
compelled
me
to
the
conclusion
that
the
disease
of
snobbishness
had
infected
them
all
with
a
few
doubtful
exceptions
so
without
my
realizing
it
my
mind
was
prepared
to
believe
that
mary
kirkwood
was
like
the
rest
when
neva
armstrong
pronounced
the
name
edna
had
given
there
shot
through
me
that
horrible
feeling
of
insufferable
heat
and
insufferable
cold
which
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
to
describe
for
those
who
have
felt
it
will
understand
at
once
and
those
who
have
not
could
not
be
made
to
understand
and
then
i
recalled
hartley
beechman
s
jeer
she
s
laughing
at
us
both
but
my
voice
was
natural
as
i
said
tilzer
borgfeldt
that
s
the
chap
she
s
engaged
to
just
now
isn
t
it
mrs
armstrong
who
is
a
loyal
friend
flushed
angrily
mary
isn
t
that
sort
and
you
know
it
for
you
ve
known
her
a
long
time
then
she
s
not
engaged
to
him
said
i
yes
she
is
replied
neva
and
if
you
knew
him
you
d
not
wonder
at
it
i
don
t
like
foreigners
but
if
i
weren
t
bespoke
i
think
i
d
have
to
take
tilzer
borgfeldt
if
he
asked
me
no
doubt
it
s
a
first
class
title
said
i
you
know
perfectly
well
godfrey
loring
that
i
don
t
mean
the
title
she
happened
to
glance
toward
the
entrance
to
the
garden
here
he
comes
now
you
ll
judge
for
yourself
advancing
toward
us
was
a
big
happy
blond
man
of
the
pattern
from
which
nine
out
of
ten
german
upper
class
men
are
cut
he
had
the
expression
of
simple
unaffected
joy
natural
to
a
big
healthy
happy
blond
youth
looking
forward
to
seeing
his
best
girl
he
had
youth
good
looks
unusual
personal
magnetism
and
you
will
imagine
what
effect
this
produced
upon
my
mood
i
could
not
deny
that
neva
was
right
without
a
title
this
man
would
have
all
the
chances
in
his
favor
when
he
went
courting
he
had
not
a
trace
of
aristocratic
futility
you
would
have
admired
the
frank
cordiality
of
my
greeting
instead
of
sitting
down
again
i
glanced
at
my
watch
and
said
well
my
time
s
up
i
shall
have
to
go
without
seeing
horace
and
mary
but
you
ll
come
to
dinner
said
mrs
armstrong
i
m
taking
the
first
express
back
to
paris
said
i
i
found
a
telegram
waiting
for
me
at
my
hotel
mary
will
be
disappointed
said
neva
you
ll
give
mrs
loring
my
best
i
remembered
that
the
english
papers
with
the
news
doubtless
in
it
would
not
reach
territet
until
late
that
evening
or
the
following
morning
but
i
could
not
well
tell
her
what
had
occurred
good
by
said
i
shaking
hands
tell
them
how
sorry
i
was
i
may
see
you
all
in
paris
and
away
i
went
with
not
an
outward
sign
of
my
internal
state
in
less
than
half
an
hour
i
was
in
the
paris
express
i
stopped
at
paris
a
month
a
letter
came
from
her
a
bulky
letter
i
tossed
it
unopened
into
the
fire
a
week
and
a
second
letter
came
it
was
not
so
bulky
i
flung
it
unopened
into
the
fire
about
two
weeks
and
a
third
letter
came
i
got
rossiter
to
address
an
envelope
to
her
i
inclosed
her
unopened
letter
in
the
envelope
and
mailed
it
i
was
giving
myself
an
exquisite
pleasure
the
keener
because
it
was
seasoned
with
exquisite
pain
all
this
time
i
had
been
amusing
my
idle
days
in
the
usual
fashion
my
readers
who
lead
quiet
lives
the
women
who
sit
thinking
what
they
would
do
if
only
they
were
men
the
men
who
slip
away
occasionally
for
a
scampish
holiday
and
return
to
their
sober
routine
with
the
cheering
impression
that
they
have
been
most
fearfully
and
wonderfully
devilish
those
women
and
those
men
will
regret
that
i
refrain
from
details
of
how
i
amused
myself
but
to
my
notion
i
have
said
enough
when
i
have
said
in
the
usual
fashion
it
passed
the
time
as
probably
nothing
else
in
the
circumstances
would
have
passed
such
tenacious
hours
every
one
lingering
to
be
counted
but
i
confess
i
have
never
been
virtuous
enough
to
be
especially
raptured
by
so
called
vice
no
doubt
those
who
divide
actions
into
good
and
bad
using
the
good
for
steady
diet
and
the
bad
for
dessert
have
advantages
in
enjoyment
over
those
who
simply
regard
things
as
interesting
and
uninteresting
for
curiously
enough
on
that
latter
basis
of
division
practically
all
the
things
esteemed
by
most
human
beings
as
the
delightful
but
devilish
dessert
of
life
fall
into
the
class
of
more
or
less
uninteresting
but
for
the
stimulus
of
the
notion
that
he
is
doing
something
courageously
daringly
wicked
i
doubt
if
any
but
a
dull
fellow
would
perpetrate
vice
enough
to
lift
the
most
easily
scandalized
hands
in
the
world
the
trouble
with
vice
is
that
it
is
so
tiresome
and
so
bad
for
the
health
and
most
of
it
is
so
vulgar
drinking
to
excess
and
gambling
for
instance
i
have
indulged
in
both
at
times
when
hard
pressed
for
ways
to
pass
the
time
or
when
in
those
stupid
moods
of
obstinate
unreasonableness
in
which
a
man
takes
a
savage
pleasure
in
disgusting
himself
with
himself
drinking
has
a
certain
coarse
appeal
to
the
imagination
coarse
and
slight
but
definite
but
gambling
is
sheer
vulgarity
i
have
been
called
money
mad
because
i
have
made
money
finding
it
easy
and
occupying
to
attend
to
business
yet
never
have
i
cared
about
money
sufficiently
to
take
the
faintest
interest
in
the
gaming
table
gambling
all
forms
of
it
is
for
those
sordid
creatures
who
love
money
and
who
have
no
intelligent
appreciation
of
its
value
gambling
all
the
vices
for
that
matter
is
essentially
aristocratic
for
as
i
believe
i
have
explained
aristocracy
analyzes
into
the
quintessence
of
vulgarity
the
two
incompetent
classes
the
topmost
and
the
bottommost
are
steeped
in
vice
for
the
same
reason
of
their
incompetence
to
think
or
to
act
a
fourth
letter
the
bulkiest
of
all
came
from
mary
kirkwood
a
few
hours
before
it
was
delivered
a
telegram
came
from
her
a
letter
is
on
the
way
godfrey
i
beg
you
to
read
it
i
love
you
i
tore
up
the
telegram
sent
back
the
letter
without
opening
it
you
are
denouncing
me
as
inhuman
gentle
reader
perhaps
you
are
right
but
permit
me
to
point
out
to
you
that
if
i
had
not
in
my
composition
a
vein
of
iron
i
should
never
have
risen
from
the
mosquito
haunted
flats
of
the
passaic
also
gentle
reader
if
i
had
been
a
man
of
the
ordinary
sort
would
mary
kirkwood
have
been
sufficiently
interested
in
me
to
send
those
letters
and
that
telegram
a
day
or
so
after
the
return
of
her
last
letter
i
was
seized
i
can
t
say
why
with
a
longing
to
see
my
father
and
mother
and
sister
on
that
lonely
farm
out
in
new
jersey
i
had
never
felt
that
desire
since
i
first
left
home
but
had
made
my
few
and
brief
visits
out
of
a
sense
of
duty
no
of
shame
the
thought
of
them
gave
me
no
sensation
of
horror
as
it
gave
edna
and
her
daughter
when
i
remembered
them
it
was
simply
as
one
remembers
any
random
fact
they
did
not
understand
me
and
in
them
there
was
nothing
to
understand
we
had
few
subjects
for
conversation
and
those
not
wildly
interesting
and
soon
exhausted
you
will
smile
when
i
say
i
loved
them
yet
it
is
the
truth
we
do
not
always
love
those
we
like
to
be
with
we
do
not
always
like
to
be
with
those
we
love
there
was
nothing
to
detain
me
in
paris
the
hours
hung
like
guests
who
do
not
know
how
to
take
leave
so
not
many
days
elapsed
between
my
seizure
and
my
appearance
at
the
spacious
and
comfortable
stone
farmhouse
where
the
four
old
people
were
awaiting
in
a
semi
comatose
or
dozing
state
what
they
firmly
believed
was
a
summons
to
a
higher
life
their
belief
in
it
like
that
of
most
religious
people
was
not
strong
enough
to
make
them
impatient
to
get
it
still
they
believed
and
found
the
belief
a
satisfactory
way
of
employing
such
small
part
of
their
minds
as
remained
awake
i
had
not
seen
them
or
their
place
in
several
years
so
i
was
astonished
by
the
changes
my
sister
polly
a
homely
old
maid
and
edna
s
father
had
some
glimmerings
of
enterprise
polly
took
in
and
read
several
magazines
and
from
them
gathered
odds
and
ends
of
up
to
date
ideas
about
dress
about
furnishing
about
gardens
with
the
valuable
assistance
of
old
weeping
willie
she
had
wrought
a
most
creditable
transformation
the
old
people
now
looked
like
something
as
the
saying
is
and
the
place
had
a
real
smartness
both
within
and
without
polly
she
was
about
eight
years
my
senior
but
looked
old
enough
to
be
my
mother
polly
watched
me
anxiously
as
i
strolled
and
nosed
about
my
delight
filled
her
with
delight
you
re
not
so
ashamed
of
us
perhaps
said
she
i
never
have
been
replied
i
nor
did
i
put
an
accent
on
the
personal
pronoun
that
would
have
been
a
hint
about
somebody
else
s
feelings
well
you
ought
to
have
been
said
she
we
were
mighty
far
behind
even
the
tail
of
the
procession
i
ll
admit
i
like
this
better
than
the
way
we
used
to
live
in
passaic
polly
you
ve
got
the
best
there
is
going
all
the
rest
all
the
luxury
and
other
nonsense
is
nothing
but
a
source
of
unhappiness
she
did
not
answer
i
noted
a
touching
sadness
in
her
expression
you
don
t
agree
with
me
said
i
yes
i
do
replied
she
emphatically
i
wasn
t
thinking
of
that
what
have
you
got
to
be
unhappy
about
you
think
i
m
ungrateful
to
you
said
she
with
quick
sensitiveness
but
i
m
not
godfrey
indeed
i
m
not
ungrateful
i
laughed
don
t
talk
nonsense
you
ve
done
all
you
could
all
anyone
could
and
in
a
way
i
am
happy
but
yes
i
urged
as
she
hesitated
well
i
ve
found
out
looking
back
over
my
life
i
ve
found
out
that
i
it
seems
to
me
i
ve
got
all
the
tools
of
happiness
but
nothing
to
work
on
i
keep
thinking
how
happy
i
could
be
if
i
only
had
something
to
work
on
i
was
silent
a
shadow
crept
out
of
a
black
corner
of
my
heart
and
cast
a
somberness
and
a
chill
over
me
you
understand
said
she
i
nodded
i
thought
you
would
she
went
on
godfrey
i
ve
often
felt
sorry
for
you
sorrier
than
i
do
for
myself
she
laid
her
hand
on
my
arm
but
you
re
a
man
a
handsome
attractive
young
man
you
ll
have
only
yourself
to
blame
if
you
waste
your
life
as
mine
s
been
wasted
you
don
t
realize
how
lucky
you
ve
been
said
i
with
a
bitterness
that
surprised
me
you
ve
at
least
escaped
marriage
i
wish
to
god
i
hadn
t
cried
she
with
an
energy
that
startled
me
there
was
a
fierce
look
of
pain
in
her
eyes
i
thought
you
understood
but
i
see
you
don
t
what
do
you
mean
polly
ann
said
i
gently
the
real
unhappiness
isn
t
an
unhappy
marriage
replied
she
it
s
being
not
married
at
all
not
having
any
children
you
know
what
i
am
an
old
maid
you
think
that
means
the
same
thing
as
old
bachelor
well
it
don
t
why
not
an
old
bachelor
nine
times
out
of
ten
that
means
simply
an
old
selfish
comfortable
man
but
an
old
maid
the
nature
of
woman
s
different
from
the
nature
of
man
a
woman
s
got
to
have
a
home
her
home
her
nest
with
her
children
in
it
and
i
m
an
old
maid
if
i
d
been
a
man
she
turned
on
me
i
m
ugly
ain
t
i
you
know
i
am
i
know
it
dress
me
up
in
men
s
clothes
and
i
d
be
a
good
looking
person
as
a
man
but
as
a
woman
i
m
ugly
if
i
d
have
been
a
man
i
could
have
got
a
mighty
nice
mighty
nice
looking
wife
one
that
d
have
been
grateful
to
me
for
taking
her
and
would
have
cared
for
me
but
as
a
woman
i
couldn
t
get
a
husband
you
can
get
a
very
good
one
said
i
money
what
would
have
bought
you
a
wife
as
a
man
what
buys
most
men
their
wives
will
buy
you
a
husband
and
he
ll
be
grateful
and
loving
so
long
as
you
manage
the
purse
strings
well
just
as
most
wives
are
loving
and
grateful
if
their
husbands
don
t
treat
them
too
indulgently
it
s
different
and
you
know
it
is
retorted
she
custom
has
made
it
different
and
i
m
ugly
and
that
s
fatal
in
a
woman
charm
will
beat
beauty
every
time
said
i
i
ve
got
no
charm
none
on
the
outside
and
that
s
where
a
woman
s
charm
has
to
be
no
i
ve
thought
out
my
case
it
s
hopeless
i
m
a
born
old
maid
no
man
ever
asked
me
to
marry
him
no
man
ever
said
a
word
of
love
to
me
do
you
know
what
that
means
godfrey
i
was
silent
a
choke
in
my
throat
made
speech
impossible
never
a
word
of
love
she
went
on
monotonously
yet
i
don
t
suppose
any
woman
ever
wanted
to
hear
it
more
and
no
children
yet
i
know
no
woman
ever
wanted
them
more
no
not
adopted
children
but
my
own
flesh
and
blood
i
ve
heard
women
complain
of
the
burden
of
bearing
a
child
it
made
me
wild
to
listen
to
them
the
fools
the
selfish
fools
what
wouldn
t
i
have
given
to
have
felt
a
child
within
me
does
it
scandalize
you
to
hear
me
talk
like
this
no
said
i
no
it
s
a
wonder
said
she
with
a
grim
smile
she
was
quieting
down
was
hiding
the
heart
from
which
she
had
on
impulse
snatched
the
veil
was
ashamed
of
her
outburst
a
woman
can
talk
about
having
a
cancer
or
a
tumor
or
any
frightful
disease
inside
her
and
nobody
s
modesty
is
shocked
but
if
she
speaks
of
having
a
child
within
her
a
wonderful
living
human
being
a
lovely
baby
why
it
s
immodest
she
gave
a
scornful
laugh
what
a
world
what
a
world
i
looked
at
her
and
marveled
what
a
world
indeed
where
this
was
one
of
the
sort
of
relatives
of
whom
pushing
arrived
people
were
ashamed
i
think
i
forced
myself
to
stay
three
days
with
them
i
cannot
recall
perhaps
i
left
the
second
day
however
that
may
be
i
have
the
sense
of
a
long
a
very
long
visit
to
one
who
has
the
city
habit
the
country
is
oppressively
deliberate
even
when
it
is
interesting
it
makes
you
realize
how
there
is
room
and
to
spare
for
sixty
minutes
in
an
hour
for
sixty
seconds
in
each
minute
the
city
entertains
the
country
compels
you
to
seek
entertainment
to
make
entertainment
people
whose
mentality
tapers
away
from
mediocrity
grow
old
and
dull
rapidly
in
the
country
as
soon
as
childhood
s
torrential
life
begins
to
slacken
for
men
of
thought
the
country
ought
to
be
ideal
i
should
say
once
they
formed
its
habit
and
lost
the
city
habit
of
waiting
in
confident
expectation
of
being
amused
but
for
men
of
action
like
myself
for
men
whose
whole
life
is
dealing
directly
with
their
fellow
men
to
acquire
the
country
habit
is
a
matter
of
years
of
a
complete
revolution
i
brought
a
sore
and
a
sick
heart
to
the
country
i
took
back
to
town
one
that
was
on
the
way
toward
the
normal
and
i
owed
the
improvement
not
to
the
country
directly
but
to
my
sister
polly
ann
had
reminded
me
of
the
futility
of
graveyard
mooning
of
its
egotism
and
hypocrisy
she
had
reminded
me
that
only
the
fool
walks
backward
through
life
i
believed
i
had
been
guilty
of
the
folly
of
blowing
a
bubble
of
delusion
pretending
to
myself
that
it
was
no
bubble
but
permanent
substantial
real
the
bubble
had
burst
as
bubbles
must
had
burst
with
a
mocking
and
irritating
dash
of
cold
spray
straight
into
my
face
well
the
sensible
thing
to
do
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
laugh
and
blow
no
more
bubbles
i
went
back
to
finance
i
busied
myself
to
the
uttermost
of
my
capacity
for
work
but
i
could
not
uproot
the
idea
mary
kirkwood
had
set
growing
in
my
mind
i
saw
ever
more
clearly
that
my
sister
was
eternally
right
some
men
might
be
successful
bachelors
i
could
be
fairly
successful
at
that
selfish
and
solitary
profession
for
a
few
years
perhaps
for
ten
or
fifteen
years
longer
but
i
knew
with
the
clearness
of
a
vision
trained
to
search
the
horizon
of
the
future
that
the
feeling
of
loneliness
of
complete
futility
which
already
shadowed
me
would
become
a
black
pall
i
must
have
companionship
and
to
companionship
there
is
but
the
one
way
the
way
of
wife
and
children
a
poor
an
uncertain
way
nevertheless
the
only
way
you
have
perhaps
observed
the
marriages
of
the
rich
you
have
noted
that
every
rich
man
and
every
rich
woman
is
surrounded
by
a
smaller
or
larger
army
of
satellites
persons
nominally
their
social
equals
often
distinctly
their
mental
superiors
salaried
persons
wearers
of
cast
off
clothing
eaters
of
luncheons
and
dinners
permanent
free
lodgers
constant
or
occasional
pensioners
more
or
less
disguised
family
life
fails
with
the
rich
as
it
fails
with
the
well
off
or
with
the
poor
but
while
other
classes
revert
to
the
herd
life
the
life
of
clubs
saloons
teas
receptions
the
rich
take
up
the
parasite
beset
life
each
rich
person
aloof
with
his
or
her
particular
circle
of
flatterers
attendants
coat
holders
joke
makers
and
boot
lickers
now
it
so
happened
that
for
me
there
could
be
no
enduring
of
this
standing
apart
in
the
meadow
switching
my
tail
while
parasites
bit
and
tickled
buzzed
and
burrowed
riches
like
any
other
heavy
and
constantly
growing
responsibility
usually
rob
a
man
of
his
sense
of
humor
and
turn
his
thoughts
in
upon
himself
and
make
him
a
ridiculous
ass
of
an
egotist
they
had
not
had
that
effect
upon
me
i
can
give
no
reason
i
simply
state
the
fact
so
with
my
sense
of
humor
active
and
my
sense
of
proportion
fairly
well
balanced
i
could
not
give
myself
up
to
the
dreary
life
custom
assigns
to
the
rich
i
retained
the
normal
human
instincts
i
had
hoped
to
satisfy
them
to
the
uttermost
with
the
aid
of
mary
kirkwood
that
hope
had
fallen
dead
i
must
search
on
not
for
the
best
conceivable
but
for
the
best
possible
you
are
not
surprised
at
my
lack
of
sentiment
gentle
reader
by
this
time
i
am
sure
i
could
not
surprise
you
with
any
exhibition
of
that
or
other
depravity
but
it
confirms
your
conviction
of
my
utter
sordidness
so
then
you
imagine
do
you
that
there
are
many
love
marriages
in
the
world
leaving
out
of
the
count
those
in
novels
and
in
the
twaddling
gossip
men
and
women
repeat
as
the
true
heart
stories
of
this
and
that
person
yes
i
should
say
your
intelligence
was
about
rudimentary
enough
to
give
you
such
a
false
notion
of
life
as
it
is
lived
marriages
of
passion
there
are
a
plenty
rarely
indeed
does
a
man
become
bill
payer
to
a
woman
for
life
not
to
speak
of
the
insurance
without
having
been
more
or
less
agitated
by
her
physical
charms
and
usually
the
woman
eager
to
be
married
whips
up
for
him
a
return
feeling
that
looks
well
convinces
the
man
and
herself
and
makes
you
gentle
reader
sigh
and
wipe
your
sloppy
eyes
but
love
marriage
that
s
a
wholly
different
matter
i
should
say
it
almost
never
occurs
where
love
a
sentiment
of
slow
and
reluctant
growth
does
happen
occasionally
to
come
afterwards
because
the
two
are
really
congenial
really
mated
where
love
does
come
afterwards
it
did
not
exist
when
the
wedding
bells
rang
and
i
doubt
not
that
love
has
grown
as
often
if
not
oftener
where
the
motives
that
led
to
the
marriage
were
practical
and
even
sordid
than
where
they
were
the
bright
swift
fading
and
in
death
most
foul
smelling
flowers
of
passion
i
was
willing
to
buy
a
wife
if
i
could
find
a
woman
who
promised
to
wear
well
to
improve
on
acquaintance
or
at
least
not
to
deteriorate
and
beyond
question
with
my
money
i
could
have
taken
my
pick
almost
any
girl
anywhere
engaged
or
unengaged
would
have
fallen
in
love
with
me
as
soon
as
she
discovered
my
charms
of
person
and
of
purse
yes
would
have
fallen
in
love
gentle
reader
don
t
you
know
that
a
nice
pure
girl
always
makes
herself
or
lets
herself
fall
in
love
before
she
gives
herself
and
don
t
you
know
that
except
falling
out
of
love
out
of
that
kind
of
love
there
s
nothing
easier
especially
for
an
inexperienced
girl
than
falling
in
love
in
that
kind
of
love
but
where
was
i
to
find
a
woman
with
enough
solid
quality
to
give
me
a
reasonable
hope
that
she
would
aid
me
in
my
quest
for
family
happiness
do
not
denounce
me
gentle
reader
epithet
and
hiss
are
not
reply
answer
my
question
you
say
there
are
millions
of
such
girls
yes
but
where
you
say
there
are
millions
of
pure
sweet
charming
girls
intelligent
and
domestic
yes
no
doubt
but
how
long
would
they
remain
so
if
tempted
by
wealth
by
the
example
of
all
the
money
mad
luxury
mad
society
mad
women
about
them
mind
you
i
did
not
want
a
stupid
rotter
a
cow
a
sitter
and
lounger
and
taker
on
of
fat
and
slougher
off
of
intelligence
i
did
not
want
the
lazy
slattern
who
poses
as
domestic
who
is
fond
of
home
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
a
pig
is
fond
of
an
alley
wallow
you
laugh
at
me
you
say
he
is
a
conceited
fool
to
think
that
he
could
attract
and
absorb
an
intelligent
woman
with
a
complex
woman
s
soul
not
so
gentle
reader
i
did
not
wish
to
attract
and
to
absorb
her
as
for
the
complex
woman
s
soul
the
less
i
saw
or
heard
of
it
the
better
pleased
i
d
be
i
simply
wanted
a
woman
who
would
join
me
in
being
attracted
by
and
absorbed
in
family
life
you
are
still
smiling
mockingly
but
let
me
tell
you
a
few
secrets
of
wisdom
and
happiness
first
friendship
is
divine
but
intimacy
is
the
devil
himself
unless
it
is
the
intimacy
of
the
family
second
to
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
he
must
be
and
must
remain
your
neighbor
that
is
to
say
within
hail
but
not
within
touch
third
husband
wife
and
children
are
the
only
natural
intimates
intimate
because
they
have
the
bond
of
common
interest
the
family
that
looks
abroad
for
intimates
has
ceased
to
be
a
family
finally
a
man
who
has
his
wife
and
children
for
intimates
has
neither
need
nor
time
for
other
intimates
and
unless
a
man
s
wife
and
children
are
his
intimates
he
has
in
fact
no
wife
and
no
children
let
me
add
for
the
benefit
of
perhaps
of
you
and
your
husband
gentle
reader
that
the
only
career
worth
having
is
built
upon
and
with
efficient
work
careers
made
with
friendships
gaddings
pulls
and
the
like
would
better
be
left
unmade
you
are
smiling
still
in
your
smug
supercilious
fashion
smiling
at
what
you
promptly
call
old
fashioned
trite
truisms
i
am
not
sure
that
after
they
have
been
thought
about
a
while
they
would
seem
old
fashioned
or
stale
rather
i
flatter
myself
they
are
the
statement
of
a
new
philosophy
of
life
for
the
old
theory
with
which
you
are
confusing
these
truths
was
that
the
family
is
the
social
unit
in
fact
it
is
not
the
only
social
units
are
individuals
capable
individuals
my
theory
or
rather
my
philosophy
for
it
is
more
than
a
theory
my
philosophy
is
that
the
family
is
the
unit
of
happiness
society
can
and
does
get
along
fairly
well
with
little
or
no
happiness
but
happiness
is
an
excellent
thing
nevertheless
and
i
wanted
it
now
perhaps
you
see
why
i
was
not
looking
forward
with
any
exuberance
of
optimism
to
finding
the
woman
whom
i
needed
and
wanted
and
who
needed
and
wanted
me
prompted
by
my
experiences
and
guided
somewhat
by
my
shrewd
and
cynical
friend
bob
armitage
i
had
been
giving
no
small
amount
of
spare
time
to
observing
and
thinking
about
the
american
woman
and
while
i
admired
that
charming
lady
and
found
her
an
amusing
companion
for
an
occasional
leisure
hour
i
saw
that
she
was
not
to
be
taken
seriously
by
a
serious
person
she
knew
how
to
look
well
how
to
make
a
good
front
how
to
get
perhaps
a
hundred
dollars
worth
of
pleasing
surface
results
by
squandering
a
thousand
or
two
thousand
dollars
as
an
ornament
a
decoration
as
a
basket
of
rare
inedible
fruit
to
irradiate
lovely
costliness
she
could
not
be
beaten
as
wife
to
a
showy
plutocrat
ignorant
of
the
art
of
comfortable
living
as
head
mistress
to
an
european
noble
with
servants
trained
to
maintain
his
state
in
splendid
and
orderly
discomfort
she
would
do
excellently
well
but
not
for
the
practical
uses
of
sensible
life
she
had
no
training
for
them
no
taste
for
them
no
intention
of
adapting
herself
to
them
whatever
she
might
pretend
in
order
to
catch
a
bill
payer
still
i
did
not
despair
i
dared
not
despair
if
i
had
loneliness
and
heartache
yes
heartache
and
my
sense
of
present
and
future
futility
would
have
become
intolerable
on
the
other
hand
while
there
was
every
reason
for
haste
when
happiness
was
my
goal
and
life
is
short
and
uncertain
i
was
resolved
to
be
deliberate
if
i
should
be
deceived
perhaps
by
the
girl
s
honest
self
deception
into
choosing
wrong
how
she
would
hate
me
for

again
would
or
could
i
let
a
woman
use
me

edna
had
used
me
a
fool
is
a
grown
up
person
who
has
never
grown
up
i
had
grown
up
had
become
a
definite
person
knowing
what
i
wanted
and
what
i
did
not
want
such
persons
are
hated
by
those
who
try
in
vain
to
use
them
my
one
chance
lay
in
finding
a
woman
with
the
same
definite
tastes
as
mine
only
disaster
could
come
through
the
woman
who
might
marry
me
pretending
to
agree
with
me
and
secretly
resolved
to
redeem
me

she
got
me
firmly
in
her
grasp
armitage
was
back
in
new
york
was
eager
to
resume
our
old
relations
but
that
could
not
be
i
had
outgrown
him
and
he
at
the
dangerous
age
was
allowing
himself
to
harden
into
all
the
habits
of
the
rich
class
and
of
middle
life
despite
his
efforts
to
conceal
it
i
saw
that
he
had
even
reached
the
pass
where
a
man
of
property
regards
a
new
idea
as
a
menace
to
society
if
it
is
a
new
invention
it
may
make
some
stock
he
owns
worthless
if
it
is
a
new
social
or
political
idea
it
may
make
his
laborers
demand
higher
wages
or
in
some
other
way
affect
his
dividends
and
of
course
whenever
a
man
speaks
of
a
menace
to
society
he
means
a
menace
to
himself
whom
he
naturally
regards
as
the
most
precious
and
vital
thread
in
the
social
fabric
compelled
by
my
need
for
ideas
to
occupy
me
in
supplement
to
the
now
thoroughly
familiar
and
rather
monotonous
routine
of
investing
and
reinvesting
organizing
and
reorganizing
i
was
associating
more
and
more
with
artists
and
writers
of
the
sort
who
feel
suffocated
in
the
society
of
the
merely
rich
material
conditions
force
upon
men
inexorable
modes
of
life
and
every
mode
of
life
breeds
a
definite
distinct
set
of
ideas
men
fancy
themselves
original
because
they
suddenly
discover
certain
ideas
in
their
brains
as
well
might
a
hen
who
has
just
eaten
hot
bran
fancy
herself
original
because
she
laid
an
egg
the
idea
was
not
from
the
man
but
from
his
material
conditions
lawyer
idea
politician
idea
banker
idea
anarchist
idea
big
or
little
merchant
idea
dog
fighter
idea
professor
idea
preacher
idea
and
so
on
i
was
fighting
to
escape
this
to
me
repellent
molding
process
and
i
was
making
headway
but
poor
armitage
was
rapidly
yielding
his
struggle
i
fear
had
been
in
its
best
days
in
large
part
a
brassy
make
believe
the
valor
of
the
trumpet
not
of
the
sword
he
was
a
sorry
sight
his
once
handsome
face
was
taking
on
that
petty
pinched
frost
bitten
fifth
avenue
expression
and
he
had
been
driven
for
companionship
into
forming
the
familiar
parasite
circle
the
chief
figures
in
it
were
a
decaying
dandy
of
an
old
new
york
family
who
had
been
fawner
and
crumb
snapper
all
his
days
and
a
broken
down
plutocrat
who
had
squandered
his
fortune
on
fine
women
fine
wine
and
fine
food
the
dandy
gave
bob
the
fashionable
gossip
the
broken
down
plutocrat
gave
him
the
gossip
and
scandal
of
the
giddy
part
of
town
also
the
latest
gamey
stories
also
he
perhaps
both
arranged
for
him
the
peculiar
pleasures
of
the
rich
man
with
the
palate
that
needs
strong
sensations
to
make
it
respond
armitage
was
out
of
the
question
for
me
then
i
drifted
into
the
amsterdam
club
one
evening
to
write
a
note
or
send
a
telegram
and
there
sat
hartley
beechman
the
instant
he
saw
me
he
sprang
up
and
made
straight
for
me
his
expression
was
puzzling
but
not
hostile
still
i
was
unobtrusively
ready
said
he
in
a
straight
frank
fashion
loring
i
want
to
apologize
to
you
i
made
a
damned
ass
of
myself
in
green
park
last
summer
my
excuse
is
that
i
was
more
than
half
crazy
i
put
out
my
hand
i
half
guessed
at
the
time
said
i
i
know
all
about
it
now
we
looked
at
each
other
with
the
friendliness
that
has
become
the
stronger
by
a
mended
break
for
broken
hearts
and
broken
lives
and
broken
friendships
are
much
the
stronger
if
the
break
mends
said
he
one
way
of
measuring
the
strength
of
a
man
is
the
length
of
the
intervals
between
the
times
when
he
makes
a
fool
of
himself
about
a
woman
my
first
came
at
eighteen
my
next
at
thirty
eight
not
a
bad
showing
i
flatter
myself
eh
uncommonly
good
said
i
and
the
second
shall
be
the
last
optimism
i
warned
him
laughingly
beware
of
optimism
no
i
shall
write
about
women
but
i
ll
see
no
more
of
them
i
ve
got
hold
of
myself
again
i
m
as
good
as
ever
better
than
ever
probably
but
it
cost
and
i
ll
not
pay
that
price
again
for
a
while
i
thought
it
was
you
who
had
upset
my
happiness
then
he
gave
a
loud
unnatural
laugh
that
german
purchase
i
saw
she
had
been
simply
playing
with
me
you
know
how
fond
women
of
that
sort
are
of
playing
with
romantic
or
sentimental
ideas
but
when
it
came
to
the
test
why
she
would
have
married
only
a
fortune
or
a
title
i
made
no
comment
he
was
saying
only
what
i
thought
what
i
believed
true
but
i
hated
to
hear
it
i
may
wrong
her
pursued
he
reflectively
not
altogether
but
to
a
certain
extent
i
rather
think
the
impulse
to
something
saner
and
less
vulgar
was
there
actually
there
as
he
was
looking
at
me
inquiringly
i
said
i
think
so
but
nothing
came
of
it
and
there
s
little
in
these
fine
impulses
of
which
nothing
comes
little
laughed
i
why
they
produce
the
most
beautiful
decorative
effects
life
would
be
barren
without
them
what
a
repulsive
sight
the
poor
little
human
animal
would
be
grunting
and
grubbing
about
thinking
always
of
its
beloved
self
what
a
repulsive
sight
if
it
didn
t
wear
the
flowers
of
high
ideals
in
its
ears
and
the
jewels
of
fine
impulses
ringed
in
its
nose
i
think
it
would
look
better
without
them
said
he
less
ridiculous
less
contemptible
to
you
yes
because
you
re
like
i
am
coarse
but
not
to
itself
and
its
fellows
i
m
going
back
to
the
woods
to
morrow
said
he
better
come
on
a
yachting
trip
to
south
america
with
me
said
i
he
flushed
thank
you
but
i
can
t
do
that
replied
he
i
can
t
afford
it
it
was
my
turn
to
flush
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
i
spoke
without
thinking
spoke
on
impulse
you
are
quite
right
a
man
s
a
fool
or
a
sycophant
who
goes
where
he
can
t
pay
his
own
way
continued
he
i
ve
come
to
realize
that
i
ll
do
it
no
more
i
ll
stick
to
my
own
class
i
ve
been
justly
punished
for
blundering
out
of
it
but
not
so
severely
punished
as
i
should
have
been
had
my
he
smiled
ironically
my
love
affair
prospered
he
thought
for
several
minutes
then
he
said
i
wonder
when
the
clash
came
would
i
have
gone
with
her
or
she
with
me
i
did
not
reply
he
pulled
himself
together
smiled
mockingly
at
his
own
folly
of
lingering
near
the
unsightly
and
not
too
aromatic
corpse
i
must
get
into
the
woods
and
breathe
it
out
of
my
system
did
you
see
the
account
of
the
arrangements
for
her
approaching
marriage
in
this
evening
s
paper
nearly
a
page
and
i
read
every
line
when
he
had
finished
his
drink
he
rose
and
departed
and
i
have
not
talked
with
him
since
he
resumed
his
career
we
all
know
how
brilliant
it
is
as
i
have
said
before
i
have
no
sympathy
with
the
silly
notion
bruited
about
by
silly
flabby
people
that
women
ruin
the
lives
of
strong
men
now
and
then
a
woman
may
be
the
proverbial
last
straw
that
breaks
the
camel
s
back
but
there
s
a
vast
difference
between
woman
the
actuality
woman
the
mere
last
straw
and
woman
the
vampire
the
scarlet
destroyer
as
portrayed
in
novels
and
so
called
histories
those
mighty
men
made
or
ruined
by
women
why
do
we
never
see
them
why
do
we
only
read
about
them
i
resisted
the
temptation
to
follow
beechman
s
example
and
read
the
newspaper
account
of
mary
kirkwood
s
approaching
apotheosis
into
the
heaven
that
is
the
dream
of
all
true
american
ladies
there
is
but
one
way
to
do
a
thing
and
that
is
to
do
it
i
had
destroyed
or
sent
back
the
letters
i
had
resisted
the
telegram
i
could
not
yet
bar
my
mind
from
wandering
to
her
but
i
could
avoid
leading
it
to
her
and
i
did
so
it
was
by
accident
that
the
following
week
i
one
morning
let
my
eye
take
in
the
whole
of
a
four
line
newspaper
paragraph
before
i
realized
what
it
was
about
the
purport
was
that
the
engagement
between
count
von
tilzer
borgfeldt
and
mrs
kirkwood
had
been
broken
off
because
of
a
failure
to
agree
as
to
settlements
this
in
the
same
newspaper
that
contained
two
columns
descriptive
of
the
quietly
gorgeous
marriage
of
frascatoni
and
edna
in
my
son
in
law
s
new
house
near
london
failure
to
agree
as
to
settlements
faugh
i
had
calmed
until
all
my
anger
against
her
was
gone
and
i
was
thinking
of
her
as
merely
human
as
the
result
of
her
environment
like
everyone
else
i
believed
now
that
where
she
had
deceived
me
she
had
also
deceived
herself
and
i
saw
as
clearly
as
in
the
days
of
my
infatuation
that
she
and
i
had
been
made
for
each
other
that
our
coming
together
had
been
one
of
those
rare
meetings
of
two
who
are
entirely
congenial
it
filled
me
with
sadness
that
fate
had
not
been
kind
instead
of
sardonically
cruel
had
not
brought
us
together
ten
years
earlier
before
the
world
had
poisoned
her
originally
simple
and
sincere
nature
but
how
absurd
to
linger
over
impossible
might
have
beens
i
had
gone
as
far
as
i
cared
to
go
in
the
company
of
those
who
have
made
fools
of
themselves
for
love
i
believed
i
could
trust
myself
with
her
in
the
same
neighborhood
but
i
was
not
sure
and
i
would
take
no
chance
a
few
days
after
i
read
of
the
broken
engagement
i
departed
on
the
yachting
trip
to
south
america
xiv
there
were
but
two
in
my
party
dugdale
the
playwright
and
myself
a
more
amusing
man
than
dugdale
never
lived
he
was
amusing
both
consciously
and
unconsciously
a
mountain
of
a
man
bone
and
muscle
little
fat
he
had
eyes
that
were
large
but
were
so
habitually
squinted
the
better
to
see
every
detail
of
everything
that
they
seemed
small
and
his
expression
severe
to
the
verge
of
savageness
changed
the
instant
he
spoke
into
childlike
simplicity
and
good
humor
he
made
money
easily
large
sums
of
money
for
he
had
the
talent
for
success
but
he
spent
long
before
he
made
i
think
it
must
have
been
his
secret
ambition
to
owe
everybody
in
the
world
except
his
friends
from
a
friend
he
never
borrowed
the
general
belief
was
that
he
had
never
paid
back
a
loan
and
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it
what
did
he
do
with
his
borrowings
loaned
them
to
his
friends
who
were
hard
up
if
the
list
of
those
he
owed
was
long
the
list
of
those
who
owed
him
was
longer
if
he
never
paid
back
neither
was
he
ever
paid
he
could
work
at
sea
or
anywhere
else
no
doubt
even
in
a
balloon
on
that
trip
he
toiled
prodigiously
crouched
over
a
foolish
little
table
in
his
cabin
smoking
endless
cigarettes
and
setting
down
with
incredible
rapidity
illegible
words
in
a
tiny
writing
that
contrasted
grotesquely
with
the
enormous
hand
holding
the
pencil
he
labored
altogether
at
night
after
i
had
gone
to
bed
he
was
always
astir
before
me
he
slept
unbelievably
little
probably
kept
up
on
the
quantities
of
whisky
he
drank
however
that
may
be
he
was
as
active
by
day
physically
as
he
was
mentally
by
night
he
was
all
over
the
boat
always
finding
something
to
do
something
for
me
as
well
as
for
himself
the
only
terms
on
which
dugdale
would
consent
to
go
were
that
i
should
keep
him
away
from
new
york
not
less
than
two
months
and
that
i
should
take
no
one
else
i
promptly
assented
to
both
conditions
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
put
me
under
a
heavy
debt
of
gratitude
for
congenial
society
we
had
made
several
long
trips
together
always
with
satisfaction
on
both
sides
whatever
else
you
may
think
of
me
i
hope
i
have
at
least
convinced
you
that
i
am
not
one
of
those
rich
men
who
rely
for
consideration
upon
their
wealth
i
believe
i
am
one
of
the
few
rich
men
who
can
justly
claim
that
distinction
when
i
ask
a
man
less
well
off
than
i
am
to
dine
with
me
or
to
accept
my
hospitality
in
any
way
i
ask
him
because
i
want
him
and
i
do
not
either
directly
or
indirectly
try
to
make
him
feel
that
he
is
being
honored
i
would
not
ask
the
sort
of
man
who
feels
honored
by
being
in
the
society
of
bank
accounts
or
of
any
other
glittering
symbols
in
substitute
for
good
fellowship
you
will
see
gentle
reader
that
my
list
was
short
indeed
it
is
one
of
the
not
few
drawbacks
of
riches
that
they
rouse
the
instinct
of
cupidity
in
nearly
all
human
beings
the
rich
man
glances
round
at
a
circle
of
constrained
faces
each
more
or
less
unsuccessfully
striving
to
veil
from
him
the
glistening
eye
and
the
watery
lip
of
the
gold
hunger
probably
you
know
how
pepsin
is
got
for
the
market
how
they
pen
pigs
so
that
their
snouts
almost
touch
food
which
they
can
by
no
straining
and
struggling
reach
how
the
unhappy
creatures
soon
begin
to
drip
then
to
slobber
then
to
stream
into
the
receiving
trough
under
their
jaws
the
pepsin
which
the
sight
of
the
food
starts
their
stomachs
to
secreting
as
i
have
looked
at
the
parasite
circles
of
some
of
my
friends
i
have
often
been
reminded
of
the
pepsin
pigs
some
of
my
friends
like
these
displays
encourage
them
in
every
way
associate
solely
with
pepsin
pigs
i
confess
i
have
never
acquired
the
least
taste
for
that
sort
of
entertainment
i
have
traveled
the
world
over
and
everywhere
i
have
found
men
either
industriously
engaged
in
cringing
or
looking
hopefully
about
for
some
one
to
cringe
to
them
well
what
of
it
i
owe
dugdale
a
debt
i
cannot
hope
to
repay
he
a
light
hearted
philosopher
made
me
light
hearted
he
kept
my
sense
of
humor
and
my
sense
of
proportion
constantly
active
there
is
a
stripe
of
philosopher
of
the
light
hearted
variety
who
lets
his
perception
of
the
fundamental
futility
of
life
and
all
that
therein
is
discourage
him
from
everything
but
cynical
laughter
at
himself
and
at
the
world
that
sort
is
a
shallow
ass
fit
company
for
no
one
but
the
bleary
blowsy
wrecks
to
whose
level
he
rapidly
sinks
dugdale
and
i
were
of
the
other
school
we
did
not
at
least
not
habitually
exaggerate
our
own
importance
it
caused
no
swelling
of
the
head
in
him
that
his
name
was
known
wherever
people
went
to
the
theater
or
in
me
that
i
usually
had
to
be
taken
into
account
when
they
did
anything
important
in
finance
we
did
not
measure
the
world
or
rank
its
inhabitants
according
to
the
silly
standards
in
general
use
but
at
the
same
time
we
appreciated
that
to
work
and
to
work
well
was
the
only
sensible
way
to
pass
the
few
swift
years
assigned
us
it
takes
a
serious
man
to
make
even
a
good
joke
a
frivolous
person
can
do
nothing
that
is
why
so
many
of
our
american
women
and
so
many
of
the
men
too
sink
into
insignificance
as
soon
as
the
first
freshness
of
youth
is
gone
from
them
youth
has
charm
simply
as
youth
because
it
seems
to
be
a
brilliant
promise
when
the
promise
goes
to
protest
the
charm
vanishes
i
shall
reserve
what
i
saw
and
heard
in
south
america
for
another
volume
one
of
a
different
kind
i
shall
go
forward
to
the
following
spring
when
i
was
once
more
in
new
york
edna
and
her
daughter
so
i
read
in
the
newspapers
were
living
in
fitting
estate
in
a
famous
villa
they
had
taken
in
the
fashionable
part
of
the
south
of
france
for
the
health
of
the
two
young
sons
of
the
marchioness
frascatoni
was
gambling
at
monte
carlo
crossley
was
at
his
government
post
in
london
i
could
fill
in
the
tiresome
details
for
both
the
wives
and
the
husbands
and
so
probably
can
you
while
some
business
matters
were
settling
i
was
turning
over
in
my
mind
plans
for
making
a
systematic
search
for
a
wife
i
count
on
your
amusement
confidently
gentle
reader
if
you
wished
a
fresh
egg
for
your
breakfast
or
a
suit
of
clothes
to
be
worn
a
few
weeks
and
discarded
or
an
automobile
you
would
set
about
getting
it
with
some
attention
to
the
best
ways
and
means
but
saturated
as
you
are
with
silly
sentimentalities
about
marriage
you
believe
that
the
most
important
matter
in
the
world
the
matter
which
determines
your
own
happiness
or
unhappiness
and
also
the
current
of
posterity
you
believe
that
such
a
matter
should
be
left
to
the
lottery
of
chance
well
i
had
long
since
abandoned
that
delusion
and
i
purposed
to
establish
my
life
with
as
much
thought
and
care
as
i
gave
all
other
matters
a
dull
fellow
you
are
saying
no
wonder
his
wife
fled
from
him
i
do
not
wonder
that
you
regard
as
dull
anything
that
is
intelligent
to
ignorance
intelligence
must
necessarily
seem
dull
when
any
subject
of
real
interest
is
brought
up
some
silly
empty
headed
pretty
woman
is
sure
to
say
how
dull
let
s
talk
of
something
interesting
and
there
will
always
be
a
chorus
of
laughing
assent
because
the
woman
is
pretty
so
i
accept
your
sneer
at
me
with
a
certain
pleasure
i
wish
to
be
thought
dull
by
some
people
including
some
women
very
good
to
look
at
but
out
of
vanity
and
in
fairness
to
edna
i
must
acquit
her
of
having
thought
me
dull
after
she
had
been
about
the
world
one
evening
at
the
federal
club
i
fell
in
with
my
old
acquaintance
sam
cauldwell
the
fashionable
physician
he
was
something
more
than
that
or
had
been
but
was
too
lazy
to
use
his
mind
when
his
gift
for
sympathetic
and
flattering
gab
brought
him
in
plenty
of
money
cauldwell
was
a
trained
thoroughgoing
sycophant
and
snob
but
he
saw
the
humorous
aspect
of
the
gods
he
was
on
his
knees
before
and
saw
the
humor
of
his
being
there
he
knew
the
kind
of
man
i
was
and
liked
to
take
me
aside
and
make
sport
of
his
deities
for
an
hour
over
a
bottle
of
wine
also
he
liked
the
idea
of
being
and
of
being
seen
intimate
with
a
man
conspicuous
for
wealth
and
for
the
social
position
of
his
family
the
ex
husband
of
a
princess
the
father
of
a
marchioness
gentle
reader
if
you
wish
to
see
human
nature
to
its
depth
you
must
occupy
such
a
position
as
mine
believe
me
you
are
mistaken
in
thinking
the
traits
you
shamedly
hide
are
unique
there
are
others
like
you
many
others
cauldwell
was
perhaps
ten
years
older
than
i
but
being
a
well
taken
care
of
new
yorker
he
passed
for
a
young
man
which
indeed
he
was
i
do
not
regard
fifty
as
anything
but
young
unless
it
insists
upon
another
estimate
by
looking
older
than
it
really
is
i
shall
assuredly
be
young
at
fifty
perhaps
younger
than
i
am
now
for
i
take
better
care
of
my
health
every
year
and
i
have
health
worth
taking
care
of
but
as
i
was
about
to
say
cauldwell
had
a
meditative
look
that
night
as
we
sat
down
to
dinner
together
and
when
he
had
drunk
his
third
glass
of
champagne
he
said
loring
why
the
devil
don
t
you
get
married
i
felt
that
he
had
something
especial
to
say
to
me
i
answered
indifferently
why
don
t
you
very
simple
replied
he
not
rich
enough
to
marry
in
new
york
a
man
must
be
either
a
pauper
or
a
cr
sus
then
marry
a
rich
girl
said
i
i
d
have
done
it
long
ago
if
i
could
he
confessed
with
a
laugh
but
i
ve
never
been
able
to
get
at
the
girls
who
are
rich
enough
their
mammas
guard
them
for
plutocrats
or
titles
but
you
really
it
s
a
shame
for
you
to
stay
single
i
know
a
dozen
women
who
re
losing
sleep
longing
for
you
for
themselves
or
for
some
lovely
young
daughter
pathetic
said
i
i
see
that
irritates
you
well
you
needn
t
be
alarmed
you
re
famed
for
being
about
the
wariest
bird
in
the
preserves
and
i
know
you
don
t
want
that
kind
of
woman
why
not
take
the
kind
you
do
want
where
is
she
said
i
i
could
name
a
dozen
rejoined
he
but
i
shan
t
name
any
i
have
one
in
mind
a
doctor
has
the
best
opportunity
in
the
world
to
find
out
about
women
about
men
too
the
truth
about
them
i
laughed
if
i
wanted
misinformation
about
human
nature
said
i
i
d
go
to
a
doctor
or
a
preacher
they
re
the
depositories
of
all
the
hysterical
tommyrot
all
the
sentimental
lies
that
vain
women
and
men
think
out
about
themselves
and
their
sex
relations
his
smile
was
not
a
denial
yes
i
ve
been
rather
credulous
i
ll
admit
said
he
and
men
and
women
do
tell
the
most
astounding
whoppers
about
themselves
especially
women
having
trouble
with
their
husbands
i
try
not
to
believe
but
i
m
caught
every
once
in
a
while
a
gleam
in
his
eye
made
me
wonder
whether
he
wasn
t
thinking
of
some
yarn
edna
had
spun
for
him
about
me
probably
there
are
precious
few
women
even
among
the
fairly
close
mouthed
who
don
t
take
advantage
of
the
family
doctor
to
indulge
in
the
passion
for
romancing
but
i
wasn
t
thinking
of
any
confession
he
went
on
several
women
have
confessed
a
secret
passion
for
you
to
me
with
the
hope
that
i
d
help
them
the
woman
i
have
in
mind
isn
t
that
sort
i
don
t
know
that
she
cares
anything
about
you
i
only
know
that
she
s
exactly
the
woman
for
you
interesting
said
i
she
s
young
unusually
pretty
and
in
a
distinguished
way
she
knows
how
to
run
a
house
as
a
home
and
she
s
about
the
only
woman
i
know
in
our
class
who
does
she
s
got
a
good
mind
not
for
a
woman
but
for
anybody
and
she
needs
a
husband
and
children
and
a
home
he
must
have
misunderstood
the
peculiar
expression
of
my
face
for
he
hastened
on
not
that
she
s
poor
on
the
contrary
she
s
rich
i
d
not
recommend
a
poor
girl
to
you
poor
girls
can
think
of
nothing
but
money
naturally
everybody
rich
and
poor
thinks
of
money
naturally
said
i
guess
you
re
right
laughed
he
but
it
looks
worse
in
a
poor
girl
i
should
say
the
opposite
a
feeding
glutton
looks
worse
than
a
feeding
famished
man
at
any
rate
this
woman
i
have
in
mind
isn
t
poor
that
s
not
a
disadvantage
is
it
not
a
hopeless
obstacle
said
i
by
the
way
what
are
her
disadvantages
well
she
s
been
married
before
so
have
i
said
i
but
on
the
other
hand
she
has
no
children
neither
have
i
said
i
without
thinking
i
hastened
to
add
my
only
child
is
married
and
splendidly
married
said
he
with
the
snob
s
enthusiasm
to
return
to
the
lady
said
i
dryly
why
don
t
you
marry
her
yourself
he
had
drunk
several
more
glasses
of
the
champagne
he
laughed
she
wouldn
t
look
at
me
she
sees
straight
through
me
she
wants
a
man
with
domestic
tastes
i
m
about
as
fit
for
domestic
life
as
a
fire
engine
horse
for
an
old
maid
s
ph
ton
well
who
is
it
said
i
i
m
afraid
you
ll
think
she
s
been
at
me
to
help
her
but
on
my
honor
loring
she
isn
t
that
sort
we
ve
talked
of
you
for
some
reason
ever
since
i
ve
known
her
well
i
ve
never
seen
her
without
thinking
of
you
i
often
talk
of
you
to
her
not
marrying
talk
i
d
not
dare
but
in
a
friendly
sort
of
way
she
listens
says
nothing
but
she
is
sickly
said
i
sickly
he
cried
he
looked
horrified
and
amazed
good
lord
what
gave
you
that
notion
you
said
you
saw
her
often
oh
i
see
it
was
her
brother
who
had
the
illness
all
right
bring
her
round
and
i
ll
look
her
over
said
i
carelessly
and
i
forced
a
change
of
subject
had
mary
kirkwood
been
taking
this
agreeable
insidious
doctor
into
her
confidence
i
did
not
know
i
do
not
know
i
have
reasons
for
thinking
he
told
the
literal
truth
and
yet
women
are
queer
about
doctors
however
that
s
a
small
matter
the
thing
that
impressed
me
that
agitated
me
as
he
talked
was
the
picture
he
by
implication
was
making
of
mary
kirkwood
alone
again
and
evidently
absolutely
unattached
living
alone
in
the
country
as
when
i
first
knew
her
i
tossed
and
fretted
away
most
of
the
hours
of
that
night
with
the
result
that
at
breakfast
i
resolved
to
leave
town
again
to
put
the
width
of
the
continent
or
of
the
ocean
between
me
and
temptation
to
folly
but
one
thing
and
another
came
up
to
detain
me
it
was
perhaps
ten
days
later
that
i
walking
alone
in
the
park
as
was
my
habit
found
myself
at
a
turning
face
to
face
with
her
i
don
t
think
my
expression
reflected
credit
upon
my
boasted
self
control
as
for
her
i
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
and
she
is
not
one
of
the
fainting
kind
we
gazed
at
each
other
in
fright
and
embarrassment
and
both
had
the
same
child
s
impulse
to
turn
and
fly
one
of
those
sensible
natural
instincts
for
the
shortest
way
out
of
difficult
situations
that
the
cowardly
conventionality
of
the
grown
up
estate
makes
it
impossible
to
obey
but
we
had
to
do
something
so
we
laughed
she
put
out
her
hand
i
took
it
how
well
you
are
looking
said
i
and
it
was
the
truth
you
too
said
she
i
turned
to
walk
with
her
we
strolled
along
cheerfully
and
contentedly
talking
of
the
early
spring
of
flowers
and
birds
and
such
neutral
matters
i
was
fluent
she
no
less
so
our
agitation
disappeared
our
sense
of
congeniality
returned
our
acquaintance
seemed
to
have
lumped
back
to
where
it
was
before
we
had
that
first
confidential
talk
together
on
the
yacht
after
perhaps
an
hour
as
agreeable
an
hour
as
i
ever
spent
she
said
she
must
go
home
as
she
had
an
engagement
on
the
way
to
the
sixty
fifth
street
entrance
the
conversation
lagged
somewhat
we
were
both
busily
resolving
the
same
thing
the
matter
of
explanations
now
that
i
was
seeing
her
again
a
wholly
different
matter
from
inspecting
my
defaced
and
smirched
and
battered
image
of
her
battered
by
the
blows
of
my
jealousy
and
anger
and
scorn
now
that
i
was
seeing
her
again
i
could
not
but
see
and
feel
that
she
was
in
reality
a
sweet
and
simple
and
attractive
woman
no
doubt
she
had
her
faults
as
all
of
us
have
grave
faults
of
inheritance
of
education
of
environment
but
who
was
i
that
i
should
sit
in
judgment
on
her
i
realized
that
i
had
judged
her
unjustly
so
far
as
her
treatment
of
me
was
concerned
assuming
that
she
was
tainted
with
snobbishness
assuming
that
her
defects
were
as
bad
as
i
had
thought
in
my
worst
paroxysms
still
that
did
not
alter
the
charms
and
the
fine
qualities
we
are
friends
said
i
abruptly
i
hope
so
said
she
she
added
i
know
so
without
discussion
or
explanation
that
is
best
don
t
you
think
replied
she
i
am
not
not
proud
of
some
things
i
did
nor
i
of
some
things
i
did
i
should
like
to
forget
them
my
own
and
yours
i
too
and
explanations
do
not
explain
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
she
smiled
and
nodded
she
said
the
latter
part
of
the
week
i
m
going
back
to
the
country
perhaps
you
ll
spend
saturday
and
sunday
there
thank
you
said
i
let
me
know
at
the
federal
club
if
your
plans
change
at
her
door
we
shook
hands
but
both
lingered
said
she
i
am
glad
we
are
friends
again
it
was
inevitable
i
replied
we
like
each
other
too
well
not
to
have
come
round
bitternesses
and
enmities
are
stupid
and
sad
said
she
when
we
met
again
at
her
house
in
the
country
there
was
no
constraint
on
either
side
we
knew
that
neither
of
us
had
the
power
to
breach
much
less
to
remove
the
barrier
between
us
we
ignored
its
existence
and
were
content
you
may
have
observed
that
i
have
rarely
been
able
to
speak
of
edna
without
resentment
i
shall
now
tell
you
why
the
friendship
between
mary
kirkwood
and
me
presently
set
the
newspaper
gossips
to
talking
our
engagement
was
announced
again
and
again
the
announcement
always
a
pretext
for
rehashing
the
story
of
the
matrimonial
bankruptcy
through
which
each
had
passed
but
as
we
were
above
the
reach
of
the
missiles
of
the
scandalmongers
the
worst
that
was
printed
produced
only
a
slight
and
brief
irritation
this
until
the
princess
frascatoni
began
her
campaign
of
slander
i
shall
not
go
into
it
i
shall
simply
say
that
she
ordered
one
of
her
hangers
on
one
of
the
semi
literary
parasites
to
be
found
in
the
train
of
every
rich
person
to
attack
mary
and
me
as
keeping
up
an
intrigue
of
long
standing
the
one
that
was
the
real
cause
of
my
wife
s
divorcing
me
when
i
read
the
first
of
these
articles
i
believed
from
certain
details
that
no
one
in
the
world
but
the
princess
frascatoni
could
have
inspired
it
but
with
my
habitual
caution
i
leashed
my
impetuous
anger
and
did
not
condemn
her
until
i
had
investigated
is
it
not
strange
is
it
not
the
irony
of
fate
that
in
every
serious
crisis
of
my
life
except
one
i
should
have
had
coolness
and
self
control
and
that
the
one
exception
should
have
been
when
i
loved
mary
kirkwood
and
condemned
her
unheard
after
all
i
am
not
sure
that
love
isn
t
a
kind
of
lunacy
why
did
edna
engage
in
that
campaign
of
slander
why
did
she
say
to
everyone
from
this
side
the
most
malicious
the
most
mendacious
things
about
my
relations
with
mrs
kirkwood
that
she
had
ignored
the
intrigue
as
long
as
she
could
for
the
sake
of
her
dear
daughter
that
it
had
driven
her
from
new
york
had
forced
her
to
get
a
divorce
and
so
on
through
the
gamut
of
malignant
lying
there
may
perhaps
be
a
clew
to
the
mystery
in
the
failure
of
her
second
marriage
as
a
marriage
i
mean
not
of
course
as
a
social
enterprise
for
there
it
was
a
world
renowned
success
if
the
clew
is
not
in
edna
s
emptiness
of
heart
and
boredom
then
i
can
suggest
no
explanation
i
imagine
she
had
been
hearing
and
reading
the
gossip
about
an
impending
marriage
between
mrs
kirkwood
and
me
until
she
had
concluded
that
there
must
be
truth
in
it
and
by
outrageous
slander
she
hoped
to
make
it
impossible
the
first
effect
was
as
she
had
probably
calculated
mary
and
i
avoided
each
other
mary
hid
herself
and
would
see
no
one
armitage
and
i
for
a
time
kept
up
a
pretense
of
close
friendship
or
rather
publicly
again
pretended
a
friendship
that
had
long
since
all
but
ceased
but
when
the
talk
both
in
the
newspapers
and
among
our
acquaintances
grew
until
the
at
last
uncovered
scandal
was
the
chief
topic
of
gossip
he
and
i
almost
stopped
speaking
you
may
wonder
why
he
or
i
or
both
of
us
did
not
do
something
to
crush
the
absurd
lie
gentle
reader
did
you
ever
try
to
kill
a
scandal
it
is
done
in
novels
and
on
the
stage
but
in
life
the
silly
ass
who
draws
his
sword
and
attacks
a
pestilent
fog
accomplishes
nothing
beyond
attracting
more
attention
to
the
fog
by
his
absurd
and
futile
gesticulations
the
world
had
made
up
its
nasty
little
mind
that
the
relations
between
mary
kirkwood
divorced
and
godfrey
loring
divorced
were
not
and
for
years
had
not
been
what
they
should
be
and
the
matter
was
settled
i
think
armitage
himself
believed
i
know
beechman
believed
for
he
pointedly
crossed
the
street
to
avoid
speaking
to
me
i
stood
this
for
a
month
then
i
went
down
to
mary
s
place
on
long
island
you
may
imagine
the
excitement
my
coming
caused
among
the
honest
yeomanry
gathered
at
the
station
those
worthy
folk
who
peep
and
pry
into
the
business
of
their
fashionable
overlords
and
are
learning
to
cringe
like
english
peasants
i
found
mary
setting
out
for
a
ride
through
her
own
grounds
she
was
ashamed
to
venture
abroad
i
came
upon
her
abruptly
instead
of
the
terror
and
aversion
i
had
steeled
myself
to
meet
i
got
a
radiance
of
welcome
that
made
my
heart
leap
but
in
an
instant
she
had
remembered
and
was
almost
in
a
panic
please
send
the
groom
away
with
the
horse
said
i
let
us
walk
up
and
down
here
before
the
house
she
hesitated
obeyed
the
broad
space
before
the
house
was
laid
out
in
hedges
and
blooming
beds
with
a
long
straight
drive
leading
in
one
direction
to
the
highroad
in
the
other
direction
to
stable
carriage
house
and
garage
when
we
were
securely
alone
i
said
have
you
missed
me
our
friendship
meant
a
lot
to
me
replied
she
i
have
discovered
that
it
s
the
principal
thing
in
my
life
said
i
we
paced
the
length
of
the
drive
toward
the
lodge
in
silence
as
we
turned
toward
the
house
again
i
said
i
have
chartered
the
largest
yacht
i
could
get
for
a
cruise
round
the
world
a
pause
then
she
in
a
constrained
voice
when
do
you
start
immediately
i
answered
perhaps
to
morrow
she
halted
leaned
against
a
tree
and
gazed
out
through
the
shrubbery
you
ve
not
been
well
said
i
i
never
am
when
i
lose
interest
in
life
replied
she
you
will
be
gone
long
long
said
i
either
we
shall
not
see
each
other
again
for
years
or
i
paused
after
a
wait
of
fully
a
minute
she
looked
inquiringly
at
me
mary
said
i
shall
we
take
a
motor
launch
and
go
over
to
connecticut
and
be
married
she
began
to
walk
again
i
keeping
pace
with
her
it
s
the
only
sensible
thing
to
do
said
i
it
s
the
only
way
out
of
this
mess
and
to
morrow
we
ll
sail
away
and
not
come
back
until
until
we
are
good
and
ready
i
waited
a
moment
then
went
on
and
i
had
the
feeling
that
i
was
saying
what
we
were
both
thinking
we
ve
had
the
same
experience
have
been
through
the
same
bankruptcy
it
has
taught
us
i
think
i
hope
i
can
t
be
sure
human
nature
learns
slowly
and
badly
but
i
see
a
good
chance
for
us
not
to
be
utterly
and
always
blissfully
happy
but
to
get
far
more
out
of
life
than
either
is
getting
or
could
get
alone
as
we
turned
at
the
group
of
outbuildings
she
looked
at
me
and
i
at
her
a
look
straight
into
each
other
s
souls
and
then
and
there
was
born
that
which
alone
can
make
a
marriage
successful
or
a
life
worth
the
living
what
is
the
difference
between
friendship
and
love
i
had
thought
and
said
that
love
was
friendship
in
bloom
but
as
mary
and
i
looked
at
each
other
i
knew
the
full
truth
love
is
friendship
set
on
fire
we
did
not
speak
we
glanced
hastily
away
at
the
front
door
she
halted
in
a
quiet
awed
voice
she
said
i
ll
change
from
this
riding
suit
and
what
did
i
say
gentle
reader
to
commemorate
our
standing
upon
holy
ground
i
did
no
better
than
she
with
eyes
uncertain
and
voice
untrustworthy
and
hoarse
i
said
and
tell
your
maid
to
pack
and
go
to
town
with
the
trunks
go
to
the
landing
at
east
twenty
third
street
can
she
be
there
by
four
or
five
this
afternoon
yes
then
i
ll
see
you
at
the
bay
at
the
launch
wharf
in
half
an
hour
i
ve
got
to
send
off
a
telegram
in
half
an
hour
said
she
and
with
a
grave
smile
and
a
wave
of
her
crop
she
disappeared
into
the
house
at
seven
that
evening
we
steamed
past
sandy
hook
at
ten
after
an
almost
silent
dinner
we
were
on
deck
leaning
side
by
side
at
the
rail
near
the
bow
we
were
alone
on
the
calm
and
shining
sea
no
land
in
sight
not
a
steamer
not
a
sail
not
a
sign
of
human
existence
beyond
the
rail
of
our
yacht
her
arm
slipped
within
mine
my
hand
sought
hers
not
a
sail
not
a
streamer
of
smoke
alone
and
free
and
together
i
forgive
you
gentle
reader
go
in
peace
the
end

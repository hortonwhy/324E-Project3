Make sure that all the files are in their correct places. In the main folder, there should be: "extract_words.py", "husbands_story.txt", and two folders containing .pde files.
Make sure that Python and Processing are installed.

Open the Python file and run it. This should create three different text files: "allwords.txt", "uniquewords.txt", and "wordfrequency.txt"

Next, open the novelvisualization.pde and wordfrequency.pde files and run them in the processing program. The former will display a random sample of words from the novel with unique coloring.
The latter will display a graph of the distribution of unique words in the novel.
